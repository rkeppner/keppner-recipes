Among Latter-day Saints, this is a common dish served for the family at funerals. Usually made with cream of chicken soup and sour cream, I needed a lower calorie version that still tasted good. This is reasonably good, and pairs well with lean ham or turkey.

### Ingredients

- 250g diced potatoes
- 1g (1/4 teaspoon) olive oil
- 100g diced onions
- 3g (1 teaspoon) steak seasoning
- dash cajun seasoning
- 1g (1/4 teaspoon) sodium citrate
- 120g reduced fat sour cream
- 50g fat free cream cheese
- 56g reduced fat cheddar cheese
- 125g (about 1/2 cup) 1% milk
- 1g (1/4 teaspoon) salt
- 14g panko bread crumbs

### Directions

1. Preheat oven or air fryer to 350ºF.
1. Place potatoes in a microwave safe baking dish, and microwave on high for 5 minutes.
1. While potatoes are cooking, sauté onions in a non-stick skillet in olive oil until translucent and showing color.
1. Add onions and remaining ingredients to the potatoes, and mix well.
1. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until bubbly and browned on top.
