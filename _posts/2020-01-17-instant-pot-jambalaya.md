I've made Jambalaya for New Year for 10 or 15 years. Red beans and rice is much more traditional, but this is much more compelling. Here is my current incarnation, hurried along with the pressure cooker. It pairs great with [collard greens]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-01-17-instant-pot-collard-greens %}) (though I'm one of the few who actually eats them).

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 16 ounces Andouille sausage, sliced thinly
- 1 chicken breast, diced
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 large green bell pepper, chopped
- 3 stalks celery, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
- 1 teaspoon filé powder
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 3 bay leaves
- 2 teaspoons red pepper sauce
- 1 1/2 cups long grain white rice
- 1 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 12 ounces peeled, deveined, cooked shrimp
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup flat leaf parsley, chopped

### Directions

1. Use _sauté_ function to fry sausage in olive oil until browned (about 2 minutes per side). Remove sausage to paper towels to drain.
2. Add chicken to remaining oil, and cook until browned.
3. Add vegetables to pot and sauté until onion is translucent.
4. Add rice and seasonings to vegetables, and toss to fully coat the rice.
5. Add diced tomatoes and stock, and stir to combine.
6. Seal and cook on high pressure for 8 minutes. When the cooking completes, natural release for 5 minutes, followed by manual release of the remaining pressure.
7. Stir the rice mixture, then add the sausage, shrimp, scallions, and parsley, and mix in. Reseal the lid, and allow everything to warm for 5 minutes in the residual heat (still set on _warm_).
8. Serve immediately.
