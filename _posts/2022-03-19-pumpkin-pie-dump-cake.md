I ran into this at a Halloween pot luck and loved it so much I practically demanded the recipe. It has become one of my favorite desserts.

### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

#### Cake Topping

- 1 boxed yellow cake mix
- 1 cup butter, cold
- 1 large package whipped topping

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF. Grease 9x13 inch casserole dish.
2. Mix sugar, salt, and spices in small bowl. Beat eggs in large bowl. Stir in pumpkin and spice mixture. Gradually stir in milk.
3. Pour pie filling mixture into prepared casserole dish.
4. Cut butter into boxed cake mix. Crumble over pie filling mixture.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 45–60 minutes, until cake is golden brown on top.
