When I want a small batch of cookies, without oatmeal.

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup margarine or butter (1 stick), softened
- 1/3 cup white sugar
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 1/4 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 1/3 cup chopped nuts (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Grease baking sheet.
2. Cream together margarine or butter and sugar. Add egg and vanilla; mix well.
3. Add flour, soda, and salt to wet ingredients, and mix in.
4. Add chocolate chips and nuts (if using), and stir in.
5. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto prepared baking sheet, arranging evenly. Bake until lightly golden, about 9-11 minutes.
6. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.
