I used to frequently order a Greek salad topped with gyro meat or shawarma at a hole-in-the wall restaurant in the Phoenix East Valley, but there are no Greek restaurants within an hour of where we live now. So, I have to make my own. The only thing I actually had to figure out was the dressing, which is a simple vinaigrette. Also, bumping into the idea of pita croutons was a happy accident. Everything else is just assembly.

To turn this into a full meal, I just throw meat in: either sliced [chicken shawarma]({% post_url 2017-09-09-chicken-shawarma-israeli-salad %}) or fried gyro meat slices that I can buy at the local WinCo Foods.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups romaine lettuce, chopped
- 1/2 cup tomato chunks
- 1/2 cup cucumber slices or chunks
- 1/4 cup red onion chunks
- 1/4 cup bell pepper chunks
- 2 tablespoons feta cheese, crumbled
- 10 kalamata olives, pitted and cut in half
- sliced pepperoncini peppers, to taste

#### Dressing _(enough for 2–3 salads)_

- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1–2 teaspoons sweetener (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- few shakes Cajun seasoning (optional)

#### Pita Croutons

- 1 pita bread, cut into 1-inch squares
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- sprinkle granulated garlic
- sprinkle dried oregano
- sprinkle salt

### Directions

1. For dressing, whisk together all ingredients in a small bowl. Adjust seasoning to taste, and set aside.
1. For pita croutons, preheat air fryer to 400°F. Place pita squares in medium bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with seasonings. Toss to coat well. Spread in air fryer and bake until nicely browned and crisp (8–10 minutes), turning once half-way through. Remove and let cool.
1. In same medium bowl, combine salad ingredients and croutons. Drizzle with about half of dressing (to taste), and toss to coat. Serve immediately.
