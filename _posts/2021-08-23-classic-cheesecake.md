When I have more time than money, I make this cheesecake instead of just buying one at the store.

### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 3 sleeves)
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1/3 cup butter, melted
- 4 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 4 eggs

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F.
2. Combine graham cracker crumbs, 3 tablespoons sugar, and melted butter. Press into bottom of 10" springform pan.
3. Beat cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and vanilla with mixer until blended. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing on low after each, just until blended. Pour over crust.
4. Bake for 55 minutes, or until center is almost set. Run knife around rim of pan to loosen cake. Cool before removing rim. Refrigerate at least 4 hours.
