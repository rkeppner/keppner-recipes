I needed a side dish to go with [pork chops]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-11-21-oven-fried-pork-chops %}), and I was unwilling to boil and mash potatoes. Instead I put together something akin to the Rice-a-Roni my mother used to serve.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups white rice
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/2 cup diced onion
- 1/2 cup diced carrots
- 1/2 cup orzo pasta
- 1/2 cup slivered almonds
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 teaspoons granulated garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons dried parsley
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest (optional)
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice (optional)

### Directions

1. Rince rice thoroughly until water runs clear. Drain completely.
2. Heat oil and butter on Instant Pot _sauté_ setting until butter is completely melted.
3. Add onion and carrots; sauté until softened. Add orzo and almonds; continue to sauté until orzo is browned. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly for 3-4 minutes, until it turns bright white.
4. Add peas, salt, pepper, garlic, and paprika, and stir for 1 minute.
5. Add parsley, lemon zest (if using), and chicken broth; stir to combine.
6. Lock lid and set the steam valve to _sealing_ position. Press the _rice_ button or set on manual for 3 minutes. When the timer goes off, let the Instant Pot "natural release" for 15 minutes, then "quick release" any remaining pressure.
10. Fluff the rice with a fork.
11. Stir in lemon juice (if using). Serve.
