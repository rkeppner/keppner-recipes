One more breakfast casserole to add to the holiday collection. This one is a spin on eggs benedict that doesn’t require poaching eggs. It does however require soaking overnight.

### Ingredients

- 2 (7 ounce) packages Canadian bacon, roughly chopped
- 6 English muffins, cut into cubes
- 8 large eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 2 scallions, sliced (reserve some for garnish)
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- sprinkle of paprika
- 1 package hollandaise sauce mix
- pinch of cayenne pepper

### Directions

1. Grease a 9x13 baking dish.
1. Scatter half of Canadian bacon over bottom of prepared dish. Top with English muffin cubes. Sprinkle with remaining Canadian bacon.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, scallions, onion powder, and salt. Pour over casserole. Sprinkle with paprika. Cover tightly with aluminum foil, and refrigerate overnight.
1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
1. Bake casserole, covered, for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare hollandaise sauce according to package directions, adding an additional tablespoon of butter. Finish sauce with a pinch of cayenne pepper.
1. Remove foil from casserole, and bake an additional 15 minutes, until top is lightly browned and egg mixture is set. Let stand 5 minutes.
1. Serve with hollandaise sauce and reserved scallions.
