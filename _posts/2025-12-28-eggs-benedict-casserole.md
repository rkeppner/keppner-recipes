One more breakfast casserole to add to the holiday collection. This one is a spin on eggs benedict that doesn’t require poaching eggs. It does however require soaking overnight.

### Ingredients

- 2 (7 ounce) packages Canadian bacon, roughly chopped
- 6 English muffins, cut into cubes
- 8 large eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 2 scallions, sliced (reserve some for garnish)
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- sprinkle of paprika
- pinch of cayenne pepper

#### Hollandaise Sauce

- 4 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- pinch black pepper
- dash cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1/2 cup butter

### Directions

1. Grease a 9x13 baking dish.
1. Scatter half of Canadian bacon over bottom of prepared dish. Top with English muffin cubes. Sprinkle with remaining Canadian bacon.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, scallions, onion powder, and salt. Pour over casserole. Sprinkle with paprika. Cover tightly with aluminum foil, and refrigerate overnight.
1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
1. Bake casserole, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove foil from casserole, and bake an additional 15 minutes, until top is lightly browned and egg mixture is set. Let stand 5 minutes.
1. Prepare hollandaise by separating egg yolks into a tall mug, just big enough for an immersion blender. Add water, lemon juice, pepper, and cayenne pepper, and mix with blender. Melt butter in microwave. With blender running, slowly pour hot butter into mug with egg yolk mixture; continue blending until thickened.
1. Serve with hollandaise sauce and reserved scallions.
