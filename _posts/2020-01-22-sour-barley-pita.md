When we did our [Christmas in Bethlehem dinner]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-12-25-christmas-in-bethlehem-dinner %}), I needed some kind of bread to go with it. Barley is probably more traditional than wheat, so I went with this recipe.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup barley flour
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon instant yeast
- 1 cup water
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup olive oil

### Directions

1. Combine barley flour, honey, yeast, and water in mixing bowl. Let this sponge sit for 20 minutes until small bubbles begin to appear on the surface.
2. Add all-purpose flour, salt, and olive oil. Stir together just until a shaggy dough begins to form. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
3. Turn dough onto counter and knead for 10 minutes until it becomes smooth.
4. Place in well oiled bowl, cover, and let rest for an hour.
5. Divide dough into 12 even pieces. Shape each into a ball by rolling between hands. Let rounds rest while preheating oven to 400ÂºF.
6. Place an empty baking sheet or baking stone into oven. Roll each piece of dough into a 6-inch circle. Let rest for 5 minutes.
7. Quickly place rounds onto the hot baking sheet or stone. Bake for 4 minutes.
8. Remove from oven and serve hot.
