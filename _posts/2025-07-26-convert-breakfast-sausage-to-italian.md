On the day of this writing, I paid $2.89 for a 1 pound chub of (terribly fatty) breakfast sausage (which we already use in spaghetti sauce), while the price of bulk Italian sausage was nearly $6 per pound. This isn’t as good quality as the Italian sausage, but it’s a lot cheaper and is a reasonable substitute in my [Instant Pot Zuppa Toscana]({% post_url 2020-04-23-instant-pot-zuppa-toscana %}).

### Ingredients

- 1 pound bulk breakfast sausage
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 scant teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/4 teaspoon fennel seed
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon minced onion

### Directions

1. In a bowl, combine all ingredients, and mix well. For best results, refrigerate overnight to allow flavors to meld.
1. Use in place of Italian sausage in recipes.
