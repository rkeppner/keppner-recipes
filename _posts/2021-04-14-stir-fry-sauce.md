For the rare times I still make up a stir fry, this works as a base to start things.

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon corn starch
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon sriracha sauce

### Directions

1. Combine all ingredients and whisk together thoroughly.
2. Fry meat in 1 tablespoon of oil until cooked.
3. Add vegetables and fry 1â€“2 minutes more, stirring constantly.
3. Add sauce and cook until thickened, tossing to cover.
4. Serve immediately over steamed rice.
