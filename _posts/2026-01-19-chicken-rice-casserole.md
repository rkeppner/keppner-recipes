Somehow I’ve never recorded this, even though it’s on the monthly rotation. Since I have to keep teaching it to new family members, here it is.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 cups long grain white rice
- 2 cups cooked chicken, diced or shredded
- 1 cup diced carrots (optional)
- 1 cup frozen peas
- 1 can (12 ounce) cream of chicken soup
- 8 ounces cheddar cheese, shredded
- 2 1/2 cups chicken broth
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon dried chives
- 2 teaspoons garlic rosemary seasoning
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 2 green onions, white and green parts, sliced thinly (optional)
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. Sauté onion in oil over medium-high heat until translucent. Turn off heat and stir in garlic.
3. Add onion mixture to rice in 9x13 inch casserole dish. Stir until thoroughly combined.
4. Add chicken, carrots (if using), peas, cream of chicken soup, and cheese. Mix well.
5. In a small pot, combine chicken broth, salt, and spices. Over high heat, bring just to a simmer. Pour over rice mixture and stir in gently.
6. Cover casserole dish tightly with aluminum foil.
7. Place in oven and bake for 32 minutes.
8. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove foil and fluff rice.
9. Stir in green onions and/or parsley (if using).
10. Serve.
