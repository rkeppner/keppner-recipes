Each year we follow our longstanding tradition of making corned beef and cabbage for St. Patrickâ€™s Day, but I need to record just how I do that before I forget (again). This covers all the bases, plus a few extras, and it makes a lot of leftovers. But it does take a large Instant Pot (8 quart). All you need to add is [Irish soda bread]({% post_url 2021-03-17-irish-soda-bread %}) and Kerrygold Irish butter to complete your feast.

### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 2 smallish corned beef briskets (about 4 pounds total)
- 5 pounds small red potatoes, whole
- 2 pounds baby carrots
- 1 pound green beans, trimmed
- 1 large cabbage, cored and cut into 8 wedges

### Directions

1. Cover bottom of Instant Pot with vegetable oil. Add onion slices to cover.
2. If your corned beef comes with separate seasoning packets, remove and set them aside, and rinse the briskets. If they come with the seasoning alread on the meat, just drain as much liquid as possible. Add corned beef briskets (fat side down) to the pot. Add enough water to cover the briskets or reach the maximum fill line, whichever comes first. Seal lid, and cook on high pressure for 90 minutes. When cooking completes, natural release for 30 minutes, followed by manual release of remaining pressure.
3. Use tongs to remove briskets to a cutting board and cover with foil to keep warm.
4. Add half of the potatoes, half of the carrots, and all of the green beans, in layers, to the water remaining in the pot. Place cabbage wedges on top of vegetables. Seal lid, and cook on _steam_ setting for 3 minutes. When cooking completes, immediately manual release the pressure.
5. Remove vegetables to a serving platter with tongs and slotted spoon.
6. Add remaining potatoes and carrots to the pot, and repeat steaming process.
7. Slice corned beef across the grain. Serve with the vegetables.
