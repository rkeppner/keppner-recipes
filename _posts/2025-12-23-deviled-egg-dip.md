Rachel and I both love deviled eggs, but I find the effort of making them to not be worth the end result. This dip version is a great compromise that captures all the flavors of deviled eggs without the hassle; no boiling, no peeling, no filling. Just mix everything together and enjoy with crackers or veggies.

### Ingredients

- 8 large eggs
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced (some green reserved for garnish)
- 6 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon yellow mustard
- 1/4 cup sweet pickle relish
- 2 teaspoons worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon cajun seasoning
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Paprika for garnish
- 2—3 tablespoons green olives with pimentos, chopped (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
1. Crack 4 eggs each into two large, glass ramekins. Place ramekins in a 9x13 baking dish. Fill the baking dish with hot water until it reaches the level of the eggs in the ramekins. Bake for 30 minutes, or until eggs are “hard boiled” and fully set. Remove from oven and let cool.
1. Once cool, break the eggs apart and place in food processor with scallions, cream cheese, mayonnaise, mustard, relish, worcestershire sauce, and cajun seasoning. Pulse until smooth and creamy. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
1. Transfer dip to serving bowl and garnish with paprika, reserved scallions, and chopped olives if using. Serve with crackers or veggies.
