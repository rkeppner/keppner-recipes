My wife has been a big fan of this type of soup for a long time, but this is only the first or second time I’ve attempted to make it for her myself. Fortunately, it turned out so well that I had to record the recipe for the future. To make it fancier, you can garnish it with sour cream, grated cheese, diced avocado, tortilla chips, and/or chopped fresh cilantro.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- large pinch salt
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped (optional)
- 1 tablespoon garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ginger paste
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste (optional)
- 2 tablespoons curry powder
- 1 tablespoon garahm masala
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 quart chicken stock
- 1 30-ounce can pumpkin puree
- 1 14-ounce can coconut milk
- 1-4 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1-4 teaspoons sriracha sauce (optional)
- juice of 1 lime (optional)
- salt and pepper to taste
- toasted pumpkin seeds for garnish

### Directions

1. Heat oil in large heavy cooking pot.
2. Add onion and (optional) red pepper, and sauté until onion is translucent.
3. Add garlic, ginger, tomato paste (if using), curry powder, garahm masala, and cumin. Sauté until fragrant and fond forms on bottom of pot.
4. Deglaze with 1 cup of chicken stock. Add remaining stock, pumpkin, coconut milk, sugar, and sriracha, and stir to mix.
5. Bring soup to simmer, and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes.
6. Remove from heat. Blend soup with immersion blender until smooth.
7. Add lime juice. Salt and pepper to taste.
8. Serve warm, garnished with toasted pumpkin seeds.
