I love banh mi sandwiches, but they can be can be a pain to make. This version is my cheap and lazy take on the classic, using store-bought ingredients and minimal prep.

### Ingredients

- 2 steak rolls
- about 4 ounces dark meat from a rotisserie chicken, sliced thinly across the grain
- thinly sliced jalapeño
- cilantro leaves

#### Quick Pickled Vegetables

- 1/4 cup julienned carrot
- 1/4 cup julienned daikon radish (optional)
- 1/4 cup thinly sliced cucumber
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar

#### Sauce

- 2 tablespoons Japanese mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon sriracha

### Directions

1. Toss vegetables, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Let sit for a few minutes until vegetables soften slightly. Drain excess liquid, then toss with rice vinegar; set aside.
1. Whisk together sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.
1. Slice roll in half and toast in air fryer at 400°F until crispy (about 3 minutes). Remove about half of the interior bread from the top.
1. Spread sauce on both sides of roll. Layer chicken, pickled vegetables, jalapeño slices, and cilantro leaves. Serve immediately.

Makes 2 small sandwiches.
