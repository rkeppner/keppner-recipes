This is my attempt to track my yearly experiments at making our Thanksgiving turkey as something less traditional. It largely worked out well, but it needs further refinement.

### Ingredients

- 1 whole turkey (12-14 pounds), frozen
- Kosher salt (for dry brining)
- Olive oil (for rubbing)

#### Dry Rub for Smoked Poultry

- 3 Tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 Tablespoons smoked paprika
- 2 Tablespoons Kosher salt
- 1 Tablespoon black pepper
- 1 Tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 Tablespoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
- 1/2 teaspoon celery salt
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

#### Gravy Ingredients

- Vegetable oil
- Backbone, neck, and giblets from turkey
- 1 large onion, quartered
- 4 cups water
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons butter
- All purpose flour

### Directions

1. Four days before Thanksgiving, remove turkey from freezer and place it in refrigerator to thaw.
1. Two days before Thanksgiving, remove turkey from refrigerator. If not fully thawed, submerge it in cold water in a bucket or large stock pot, changing water every 30 minutes until thawed. Remove neck and giblets packet. Pat dry with paper towels.
1. Place turkey on large cutting board, breast side down. Use a sharp knife to slice through skin and meat on each side of backbone. Use heavy kitchen shears to follow cuts to fully remove backbone. Use knife to cut through cartilage at base of breastbone to fully open the bird.
1. Flip  turkey breast side up. Press down firmly on  breast to flatten  turkey.
1. Remove breastbone by flipping back onto breast and making small incisions around each side of breastbone and using fingers to carefully work it away from meat and pull it out.
1. Generously season turkey (inside and out) with kosher salt. Place turkey breast side up on a rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for 48 hours.
1. Two hours before smoking, remove turkey from refrigerator and let it come to room temperature.
1. In a small bowl, combine all dry rub ingredients, and mix thoroughly. Rub  entire turkey with olive oil and sprinkle generously with dry rub, making sure to get under  skin where possible.
1. Prepare gas grill for indirect smoking (light only on one side) at 275°F. Fill smoker tube with choice of wood pellets, and light pellets with heat gun. Let burn for about 10 minutes, then blow out the flame and place smoker tube at back of lit side of grill.
1. Place turkey breast side up on unlit grate. Insert a probe thermometer into thickest part of breast, avoiding bone.
1. Smoke turkey until the internal temperature reaches 165°F, about 4–5 hours. Refill smoker tube as needed to maintain smoke.
1. Meanwhile, prepare gravy: in Instant Pot, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil on sauté mode until hot. Add backbone, neck, any trimmed skin, and giblets. Brown on all sides. Add  quartered onion and fry until softened and showing color. Season with salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning.
1. Add 4 cups of water and vinegar to pot, secure lid, and set to high pressure for 2 hours. When done, allow pressure to release naturally for 30 minutes, then quick release any remaining pressure.
1. Strain stock through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl, discarding solids. Skim off any fat from surface and set aside.
1. In a medium saucepan, heat reserved stock fat over medium heat, adding butter to reach 1/4 cup. Whisk in 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour and cook, whisking constantly, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
1. Gradually whisk in strained stock. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking frequently, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm until ready to serve.
1. Remove turkey from smoker and tent it loosely with aluminum foil. Let it rest for at least 30 minutes before carving.
1. Carve and serve with gravy.
