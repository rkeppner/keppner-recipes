I’ve been making [Spanish Rice in the Instant Pot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-12-26-spanish-rice %}) for a few years, but I liked how easy the [Oven Fried Rice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-02-24-oven-fried-rice %}) was to make, so I modified this to use the same technique.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 cups long grain white rice
- 1 cup carrots, diced (optional)
- 1 cup fresh chili or bell pepper, diced (optional)
- 1 cup frozen whole kernel corn
- 1 10-ounce can Ro*Tel Original tomatoes and green chilies
- 2 1/2 cups chicken broth
- 1 8-ounce can tomato sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon chipotle or chili powder
- 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano, crushed
- 2 green onions, white and green parts, sliced thinly (optional)
- 2 tablespoons cilantro leaves, finely chopped (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. Sauté onion in oil over medium-high heat until translucent. Turn off heat and stir in garlic.
3. Add onion mixture to rice in 9x13 inch casserole dish. Stir until thoroughly combined.
4. Add carrots and pepper (if using), corn, and Ro*Tel, and mix well.
5. In a small pot, combine chicken broth, tomato sauce, salt, and spices. Over high heat, bring just to a simmer. Pour over rice mixture and stir in gently.
6. Cover casserole dish tightly with aluminum foil.
7. Place in oven and bake for 32 minutes.
8. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove foil and fluff rice.
9. Stir in green onions and/or cilantro (if using).
10. Serve.
