My number one ask for bread is texture. I want a crispy crust and a chewy, open crumb. This recipe delivers both, and requires no kneading, which means I might actually make it on a regular basis. The only real trick is to handle the dough gently enough to preserve the air bubbles that form during its long rest.

### Ingredients

- 960g bread flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary (optional)
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano (optional)
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley (optional)
- 800g water
- 1/2 tablespoon instant yeast
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

### Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and herbs (if using). Whisk thoroughly to combine.
1. In a separate bowl, mix the water and yeast until the yeast is dissolved. Add the olive oil and whisk to combine.
1. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Using a wooden spoon, mix until no dry flour remains. Continue mixing for another 2-3 minutes to develop the gluten. The dough will be sticky.
1. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and cover. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 2-4 hours.
1. Dust a clean work surface generously with flour. Carefully transfer the dough to the floured surface, and lightly dust the top of the dough with flour.
1. Using a large metal spoon, cut a round shape out of the dough slightly larger than the spoon. Gently lift the dough from the side with the spoon, and transfer it to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat, leaving space between each “loaf.” Brush off any excess flour using a pastry brush.
1. Cover the loaves with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for 20-30 minutes.
1. While the loaves are rising, preheat the oven to 450°F.
1. Transfer baking sheet(s) to preheated oven. Add a shallow pan of water to the bottom of the oven to create steam.
1. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the loaves are golden brown, crispy, and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove to a wire rack to cool.
