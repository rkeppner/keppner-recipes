My wife and I _love_ Indian food, but most of the recipes I've tried at home haven't come out nearly as good as what we can get at the restaurant, so I usually don't bother. She finally talked me into trying this one, and although butter chicken isn't one of my favorites (it's at the milder end of the spectrum), this turned out _really_ well.

### Ingredients

- 4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1/2 cup butter or ghee (or a combination)
- 2 large onions, chopped
- 12 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup fresh grated ginger
- 2 tablespoons curry powder
- 4 teaspoons Garam Masala
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Kashmiri chili powder
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 29 ounces tomato sauce
- 8 ounces sliced mushrooms
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
- 4 scallions, sliced thinly

### Directions

1. Set Instant Pot to _sauté_ setting and melt butter.
2. Add onions, garlic, ginger, and spices to butter. Stir frequently until onions are soft.
3. Add chicken, mushrooms, and tomato sauce. Pressure cook on high for 7 minutes. When finished, turn off and perform a quick release.
4. Stir in heavy cream. Set to _sauté_ again and simmer for 2 minutes to thicken sauce.
5. Sprinkle with cilantro and scallions. Serve with basmati rice or [Jeera Rice]({% post_url 2020-01-30-instant-pot-jeera-rice %}).
