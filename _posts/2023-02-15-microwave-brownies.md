I know, I know; yet another brownie recipe. But I wasn’t really happy with my [single serving brownie recipe]({% post_url 2023-01-14-single-serving-brownie %}), so I found something better. This one works quite well in the microwave, but is even better in an air fryer (preferred) or conventional oven.

### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup margarine, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup cocoa powder
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional)
- 1/4 cup chocolate chips (optional)

### Directions

1. Grease 8x8 inch baking dish. If using air fryer, preheat to 320ºF. If using oven, preheat to 350ºF.
2. Cream margarine and sugar. Add eggs, vanilla, salt, and cocoa, and stir to combine.
3. Add flour, baking powder, nuts (if using), and chocolate chips (if using). Mix until well incorporated.
4. Spread evenly in baking dish. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. If using air fryer, bake for 20 minutes. If using conventional oven, bake for 25-30 minutes, until edges begin to crisp. Remove to cooling rack.
5. Allow to cool until just warm. Cut and serve, ideally with vanilla ice cream.
