This "eggplant dip" is vaguely similar to hummus and is used in the same way, but the texture is quite different.

### Ingredients

- 1 large eggplant
- 2 tablespoons tahini (roasted, not raw)
- 2–3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (1 large lemon)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- pinch cayenne pepper

### Directions

1. Prick eggplant with fork in several places and roast in medium hot grill or using high broiler setting in oven.
2. Grill, turning frequently, until the skin blackens and blisters (10–15 minutes).
3. Transfer eggplant to baking sheet and bake at 375°F until very soft (20–30 minutes).
4. Remove from oven, cool slightly, and peel and discard skin from eggplant.
5. Place eggplant and remaining ingredients in food processor, and pulse just until well combined.
6. Spoon into serving dish and garnish with olive oil, paprika, flat-leaf parsley, and/or kalamata olives.
