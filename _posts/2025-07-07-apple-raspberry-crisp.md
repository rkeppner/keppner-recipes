We have some raspberry canes that produce prodigiously each summer. In addition to what we eat fresh and freeze for later, I frequently use them in [cobbler]({% post_url 2022-07-25-simple-fruit-cobbler %}). But when I have a few apples that need to be used (usually because they’re bruised and being avoided by the kids), I can throw in some fresh raspberries and whip this up. It pairs great with vanilla ice cream as a summer treat.

### Ingredients

- 3 cups apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
- 1 cup fresh raspberries
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- pinch salt

#### Topping

- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/4 cup quick-cooking oats
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnammon
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 cup cold butter, cubed
- 1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease a 9x9 pan.
1. In a large bowl, combine apples, raspberries, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt. Toss to coat the fruit evenly.
1. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pan.
1. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, brown sugar, oats, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
1. Cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
1. If using, stir in the chopped nuts.
1. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the fruit mixture in the pan.
1. Bake in the preheated oven for 40–50 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbly.
1. Let cool slightly before serving. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream, if desired.
