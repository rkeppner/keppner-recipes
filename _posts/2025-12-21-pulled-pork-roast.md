This is another recipe that I make every few months, but I wanted to record it here for future reference. I’ve used a number of methods over time, but this is the one I like best.

### Ingredients

- 5 pounds pork shoulder (butt) roast, preferably bone-in
- 8–10 garlic cloves, peeled
- 2 tablespoons neutral, high-heat oil
- kosher salt
- freshly ground black pepper

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450°F.
1. Pat port roast dry with paper towels. Insert paring knife into roast to create small holes all over. Push garlic cloves into holes.
1. Rub roast all over with oil, then season liberally with salt and pepper.
1. Place roast in a metal roasting pan, fat side down. Roast in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
1. Remove roast from oven, reduce oven temperature to 250°F. Flip roast so fat side is up. Add 3/4 cup water to the pan. Cover roasting pan tightly with aluminum foil. Return to oven and roast for an additional 3 hours, until meat is very tender and easily pulls apart with a fork.
1. Remove roast from oven and let rest, covered, for 15–20 minutes. Remove bone, gristle, and large chunks of fat. Using two forks, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces.
1. Toss shredded pork with any remaining pan juices and barbecue sauce (if desired) to moisten.
1. Serve with rolls and additional barbecue sauce, or alongside your favorite sides.
