I love this stuff at Applebee's, but the version I made, based on sour cream, just wasn’t very close. My mother brought this version that she got from my sister-in-law to a family function, and I begged the recipe from her. It’s a real crowd pleaser.

### Ingredients

- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 16-ounce can of artichoke hearts, drained and roughly chopped
- 10-ounce package of frozen, chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 cup Mozzarella cheese, grated
- 16 ounce jar prepared Alfredo sauce
- dash of Cajun seasoning

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
2. Mix cream cheese, garlic, artichoke hearts, and spinach in large bowl until well combined. Add remaining ingredients, and mix until combined thoroughly.
3. Heat in oven for 30 minutes or until bubbly and lightly browned.
4. Serve warm with tortilla chips.
