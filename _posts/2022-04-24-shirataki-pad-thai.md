Pad Thai is traditionally made with rice noodles, but I need something with a lot fewer carbs and calories, at the moment. So, this is my current incarnation that I plan to tweak over time. Authentic it is not, but it takes care of the craving adequately.

### Ingredients

- 1 large egg, beaten
- salt
- 2 tablespoons roasted peanuts, crushed
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
- 1 small knob fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
- 3 scallions, cut into thin bias slices, whites and greens separated
- 1/2 boneless, skinless chicken breast, sliced thinly across grain
- 1 8-ounce package shirataki fettuccine noodles, drained and rinsed
- handful fresh mung bean sprouts
- 1 tablespoon cooking oil
- handful picked cilantro leaves
- lime wedge

#### Sauce Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sucralose
- 1 teaspoon tamarind concentrate
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- pinch chili flakes (ideally without seeds)

### Directions

1. Whisk all sauce ingredients together. Set aside.
2. Add pinch of salt to eggs and whisk in. Set aside.
3. Crush peanuts. Set aside.
4. Salt chicken and toss.
5. Heat non-stick skillet over high heat. Add cooking oil. When white smoke begins to appear, add chicken in single layer. Allow to cook undisturbed for 1 minute until browned.
6. When chicken is 2/3 opaque, add garlic, ginger, and onion whites. Stir aggressively until well combined. Push everything to one side of the skillet.
7. Pour egg into empty part of pan and spread into thin sheet. Let it partially solidify before breaking it into sheets. Push to side of skillet.
8. Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts, and half of peanuts. Stir everything until well combined. Add enough water to deglaze pan and get desired sauce consistency.
9. Remove to plate and serve with remaining peanuts, scallion greens, cilantro leaves, and lime wedge.
