Every time I just need “basic” white rice, I end up searching online for this method. So I’m putting it here so I can find it more easily and tweak it to my liking.

### Ingredients

- 1-4 teaspoons cooking oil
- 1-4 cups long grain white rice
- 1-4 cups water or chicken broth (equal to the amount of rice)
- Salt to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon per cup of rice, depending on the saltiness of the broth)

### Directions

1. Rinse rice thoroughly until water runs clear. Drain completely.
2. Heat oil on Instant Pot _sauté_ setting until hot.
3. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly for 3-4 minutes, until it turns bright white.
4. Add chicken broth and salt; stir to combine.
5. Lock lid and set the steam valve to _sealing_ position. Set on manual for 4 minutes. When the timer goes off, let the Instant Pot “natural release” for 15 minutes, then “quick release” any remaining pressure.
6. Fluff the rice, and serve.
