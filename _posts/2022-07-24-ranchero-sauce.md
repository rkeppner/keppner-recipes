This Mexican take on spicy tomato sauce is perfect for serving up Huevos Rancheros (fried egg on corn tortilla with this tomato sauce) or Chile Rellenos. I may even try it for a Mexican inspired pizza.

### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1/4 cup diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon chipotle powder
- 1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano, crushed
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- pinch ground cinnamon
- black pepper to taste
- 2/3 cup chicken broth
- 1 cup crushed tomatoes

### Directions

1. Heat oil in saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and salt to pan. Fry, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent and edges are brown.
2. Add spices and stir for a minute until fragrant.
3. Deglaze pan with chicken broth.
4. Add crushed tomatoes, and stir to mix.
5. Bring sauce just to a boil and reduce to simmer. Simmer slowly for 30 minutes, adding more chicken broth or water as needed to maintain desired consistency.
