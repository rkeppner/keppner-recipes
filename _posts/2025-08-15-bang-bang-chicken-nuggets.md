I’ve been seeing bang bang chicken recipes all over the place, but breading and frying chicken in oil isn’t going to happen. So I adapted this recipe to use an air fryer and store-bought chicken nuggets. It works.

### Ingredients

- 6–12 frozen chicken nuggets
- vegetable oil (in a squirt bottle)

#### Bang Bang Sauce

- 2 tablespoons Japanese mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce
- 1 tablespoon sriracha

### Directions

1. Preheat air fryer to 400°F. Arrange the nuggets in single layer in a small pan that will fit in the air fryer basket (I use a round, 6-inch cake pan), and lightly coat them with vegetable oil. Cook until brown and almost crunchy (15-20 minutes), flipping halfway through.
1. While the nuggets are cooking, whisk together the bang bang sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.
1. Once the nuggets are done, toss them in the bang bang sauce until evenly coated. Serve immediately.

Makes 1–2 servings.
