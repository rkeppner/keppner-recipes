This is one of the last Indian dishes I haven’t regularly made at home, though it’s my go-to order at the local Indian restaurant. Time to master it! Like [Butter Chicken]({% post_url 2025-06-29-butter-chicken-from-rotisserie %}), it pairs best with [Jeera Rice]({% post_url 2020-01-30-instant-pot-jeera-rice %}) and/or naan.

### Paneer Ingredients

- 1 gallon whole milk
- 1/3 cup lemon juice
- salt to taste (about 1 teaspoon)

### Paneer Directions

1. Bring the milk to a boil in a large pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. Once boiling, remove from heat and add lemon juice, stirring gently until the milk curdles and separates into curds and whey (about 30 seconds). Let stand 10 minutes.
1. Line a colander with cheesecloth and place it over a large bowl. Pour the curdled milk into the colander, and let it stand for a few minutes. Rinse the curds under cold water to remove the lemon flavor.
1. Gather the corners of the cheesecloth and squeeze out excess whey. Sprinkle salt over the curds and mix gently. Wrap the curds tightly in the cheesecloth and squeeze again. Knot the cloth to secure.
1. Place the paneer bundle on a paper towel lined plate with the knot to the side. Place a heavy skillet on top to press it down, then add a couple of heavy cans onto the skillet. Let drain for 20 minutes.
1. Once firm, cut the paneer into cubes. If storing longer term, freeze cubes on a lined baking sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag.

### Saag Ingredients

- 2 bunches fresh spinach, washed and chopped
- 1 bunch mustard greens, washed and chopped
- 2 large onions, cut into chunks
- 4 large cloves garlic, peeled
- 3 inch piece ginger, peeled and cut into chunks
- 1-2 green chilies, chopped (optional)
- 1 cup water
- Small pinch baking soda
- 2 tablespoons fine cornmeal
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1 batch paneer (below)

#### Tadka (finishing oil)

- 1/4 cup ghee
- 1 dried red chili, whole
- 1 black cardamom pod
- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1-2 green chilies, chopped (optional)
- 4 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced

### Saag Directions

1. Add spinach, mustard greens, onions, garlic, ginger, chilies, water, and baking soda to Instant Pot. Close lid and set valve to sealing. Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes, followed by a quick release.
1. While greens are cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add paneer cubes and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides. Remove and set aside.
1. When greens are done, add cornmeal, butter, and salt. Use an immersion blender to blend until smooth.
1. For the tadka, heat ghee with dried chili and cardamom pod in a large pot over medium-low heat. When ghee is hot, add sliced onions and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, until onions are lightly golden brown. Add green chilies and garlic, and cook for another 2 minutes.
1. Pour the blended greens into the pot with the tadka. Stir in garam masala. Cook for another 5 minutes to thicken slightly. Adjust salt to taste.
1. Gently stir in the fried paneer cubes and heat through. Serve hot with rice and/or naan.
