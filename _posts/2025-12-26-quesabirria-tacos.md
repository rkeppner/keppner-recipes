I’ve wanted to make these for a while, and the holidays was finally the excuse to drop the money on beef chuck roast and the Birria Bomb spice mix. I’m not likely to make these often, but they were delicious and worth the effort.

### Ingredients

- 4 lbs beef chuck roast, cut into large chunks
- 1 Birria Bomb
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
- 2 cups water

#### Tacos

- Corn tortillas
- 2 cups shredded cheese
- 1/2 small onion, chopped
- 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped

### Directions

1. In Instant Pot, combine beef, Birria Bomb, onion, cilantro, and water.
1. Cook on high pressure for 1 hour 45 minutes, then allow natural release.
1. Break apart beef in cooker. Heat skillet over medium heat. Dip tortilla in cooking liquid, then place in skillet. Add cheese and beef, and fold tortilla in half. Cook until cheese is melted and tortilla is crisp. Flip and cook other side. Cool on rack lined sheet pan, until just warm.
1. Add chopped onion and cilantro. Serve with cooking liquid for dipping.
