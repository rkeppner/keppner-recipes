Something like cheesecake, for when I won't let anybody turn the oven on.

### Crust Ingredients

- 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) melted butter or margarine
- 20 graham crackers, crushed
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (optional)

### Cream Cheese Filling Ingredients

- 2 8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
- 1 16-ounce package whipped topping

### Fruit Filling Ingredients

Any 2 cans of pie filling can be used, but this pineapple mixture is much cheaper.

- 2 cans crushed pineapple
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup cornstarch, disolved in 1/2 cup cold water

### Directions

1. Thoroughly mix melted butter, graham cracker crumbs, and sugar. Set aside 1/3 cup of mixture. Press remainder of mixture into 9x13 inch dish. Cover and chill in refrigerator.
2. In a medium bowl, beat sugar and almond extract into cream cheese. Gently fold whipped topping into cream cheese mixture. Beat just until combined.
3. Drop about half of cream cheese mixture into crust and spread gently. Return to refrigerator.
4. Combine pineapple, sugar, and cornstarch mixture in medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring just to a boil, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and let cool completely.
5. Spread pineapple mixture over chilled cream cheese layer.
6. Drop remaining cream cheese mixture onto pineapple layer and spread gently to cover completely.
7. Scatter reserved graham cracker mixture over top.
11. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
