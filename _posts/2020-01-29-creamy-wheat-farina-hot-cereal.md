I always liked _Cream of Wheat_ cereal growing up, but we didn't have it very often. And while we've been raising our kids, we've usually opted for hot cereals that I could buy in bulk, since they end up much cheaper. But this week I found that our local WinCo sells [Bob's Red Mill Wheat Farina](https://www.bobsredmill.com/wheat-farina.html) in bulk, so I bought some to see how it compares. Turns out it tastes just like I remember, for pennies per serving.

I originally wanted to cook it in the Instant Pot, like I do with all of the other cooked cereals, but in doing a little investigating, that seems to lead to lumps. And since it takes less than 5 minutes to make it the traditional way, there's really no point in dirtying the Instant Pot.

### Ingredients

- 6 cups water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups white wheat farina
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2/3 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup whole milk

### Directions

1. Bring water and salt to a boil.
2. Slowly whisk in cereal, and reduce heat to medium-low.
3. Cook for 3 minutes, whisking frequently.
4. Remove from heat and let stand for 2 minutes.
5. Add butter, sugar, and milk, and whisk to combine thoroughly.
6. Serve warm.
