Most of the kids at my house love to douse every Mexican meal with taco sauce, but at $2.50 and up for a 7 ounce bottle, I just couldn’t keep us supplied. A little googling uncovered a few recipes for inspiration, and this is what I settled on. It makes about a quart, which lasts us two weeks or so.

### Ingredients

- 1 (29 ounce) can tomato purée
- 1 1/3 cups water
- 1/4 cup vinegar
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons granulated onion
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

### Directions

1. Place all ingredients in sauce pan and stir will to combine.
2. Simmer on low for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Remove from heat and cool. Store in a quart jar in the refrigerator.
