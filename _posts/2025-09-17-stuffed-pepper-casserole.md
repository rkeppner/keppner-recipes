Long ago we used to bake stuffed bell peppers, but the kids didn’t like them, and they were a hassle to make. But this casserole version is much easier, and if the kids don’t like it, it goes into the fridge as leftoversn for me and Rachel to enjoy later.

### Ingredients

- 1 pound 70/30 ground beef
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- pinch cayenne pepper
- 4 large bell peppers, various colors, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 cup raw basmati rice
- 2 cups tomato puree
- 1 1/2 cups beef broth
- 6 ounces shredded cheddar cheese, divided

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
1. In a large skillet over high heat, add the ground beef and a big pinch of salt, and cook for about 1 minute, breaking up the meat. Add the diced onion and continue cooking until the beef is browned and the onions are softened, about 5 minutes.
1. Reduce heat to medium and add the minced garlic. Cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Add the salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper, and cook for another minute, stirring well. Add the bell peppers and cook until heated through, about 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Add the rice and stir to coat with the rendered fat, about 1 minute. Add remaining salt, tomato puree, and beef broth, and raise the heat to high. Stir well to combine and bring to a simmer. Turn off the heat, and stir in all but 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese.
1. Transfer the mixture to a 9x13-inch casserole dish, spreading evenly. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil, and check rice for doneness. If rice is not tender, cover and continue to to bake. When rice is tender, uncover,sprinkle the remaining cheese on top, and turn the oven to broil. Broil until the cheese is melted and starting to brown.
1. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
