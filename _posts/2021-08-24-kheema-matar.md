This is a new addition to our menu. Rachel and I love it, while the kids won't touch it. It comes very close to what we're used to in an Indian restaurant, while still being simple and cheap. It would probably be even better with ground lamb, and I'm sure it would work great with ground turkey as well. We like to pair it with [Jeera Rice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-01-30-instant-pot-jeera-rice %}) and [Vegetable Korma]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-08-25-vegetable-korma %}).

### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
- seeds from 4 green cardamom pods
- 10 black peppercorns
- 1/2 cinnamon stick
- 2 cloves
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- heavy sprinkle garam masala
- 1 tablespoon cooking oil
- 1/2 onion, minced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1–2 inch piece of ginger, minced
- 1–3 green chili peppers, minced
- sprinkle of salt
- 2 roma tomatoes (or canned), minced
- 1 pound ground beef (or other)
- 1 cup water
- 1–2 tablespoons lemon juice

### Directions

1. Crush with mortar and pestle or grind with grinder: mustard seed, cumin seed, fenugreek seed, cardamom seeds, and peppercorns.
2. Add ground beef to bowl and thoroughly mix with water by hand until smooth with no lumps.
3. Set pan over medium heat, and add oil. Once hot, add cinnamon stick, cloves, bay leaf, and spices you crushed. Toast for 10–20 seconds until fragrant, being careful not to burn.
4. Add onion, garlic, ginger, and chili peppers. Cook down for 5–8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and a sprinkle of salt, and cook for another 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes.
5. Turn heat to high, add ground beef with another sprinkle of salt, and break apart while frying for 8–10 minutes until cooked through.
6. Turn heat to low, and add peas, stirring until cooked through.
7. Remove from heat. Add lemon juice and another sprinkle of garam masala. Taste and season with additional salt if needed.
8. Garnish with cilantro leaves and serve with Jeera Rice or naan.
