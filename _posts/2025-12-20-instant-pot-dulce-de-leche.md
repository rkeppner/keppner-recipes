One of the simplest and easiest desserts that can be made in an Instant Pot. The baking soda helps deepen the color.

### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk

### Directions

1. In a 7 inch metal bowl, mix the baking soda with 3 tablespoons warm water until dissolved. Add the sweetened condensed milk and stir to mix well.
1. Add 1 cup cold water to the Instant Pot. Place the metal bowl with the milk mixture directly in the water. Close the lid and set the valve to sealing. Select the Manual or Pressure Cook button and set the timer for 40 minutes at high pressure. Allow a full natural pressure release afterwards.
1. Use an immersion blender to blend the dulce de leche until smooth. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled before serving.
