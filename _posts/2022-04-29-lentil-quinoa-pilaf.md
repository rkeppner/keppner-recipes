This is a great side dish when dieting, since it’s high in fiber and reasonably low in calories.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup lentils, rinsed

3. Add quinoa and sauté for 1-2 minutes.
4. Drain lentils and add to pan. Add tomatoes and chicken broth. Stir to combine.
5. Raise heat to medium high, and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
