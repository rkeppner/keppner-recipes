I finally decided that I wanted decent pizza crust enough to make it myself, but not enough to actually maintain a sourdough starter. Or knead it repeatedly. This recipe yields a great flavor and wonderful texture, and there's no real kneading to speak of. It does however take about 24 hours, so you have to think ahead.

### Ingredients

- 7 1/2 cups bread flour
- 4 teaspoons fine sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 3 cups water

### Directions

1. Whisk dry ingredients together in medium-sized bowl.
2. While stirring with a wooden spoon, gradually add water until combined.
3. Mix gently with hands to form a rough ball, incorporating all flour.
4. Cover bowl and leave at room temperature for about 18 hours.
5. Turn onto clean, floured surface. Using a dough scraper, divide into 4 or 6 equal portions (depending on how thick you want your crusts).
6. Fold each portion over several times, then form into a smooth ball. Cover tightly.
7. **Optional:** For each portion, drizzle a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil into a glass bowl, and roll dough portion in oil to cover it and the inside of the bowl with oil. Cover bowl tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks, which will further develop the flavor.

    _If this method is used, remove the bowl(s) from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature before continuing with steps below._
8. Let rise at room temperature for an additional 2-6 hours.
9. Preheat oven to maximum heat (e.g. 500 or 550 degrees). If using a pizza stone or steel, preheat it as well.
10. Dust each portion with flour and stretch to desired size. Place on pizza pan or peel. Add sauce, cheese, and toppings as desired.
11. Bake until bottom is crisp and shows dark brown spots. Remove to cooling rack until cool enough to cut.
