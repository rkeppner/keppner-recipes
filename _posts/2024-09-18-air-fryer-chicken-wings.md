I love wings, but I hate deep fat frying. While not as crispy as the real thing, these wings are a good substitute. The air fryer renders the fat out of the skin, and the wings are still juicy and flavorful. The sauce is a simple buffalo sauce, but you can use any sauce you like.

### Ingredients

- Wings from 2 chickens (8 pieces)
- Salt and seasoning to taste
- 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
- 1/4 cup prepared buffalo sauce

### Directions

1. Season wings to taste with salt and seasoning. Toss with flour to coat.
2. Place wings uncovered on a plate in the refrigerator overnight to dry out the skin, turning once.
3. Preheat air fryer to 250°F.
4. Place wings in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Cook for 20 minutes, shaking the basket after 10 minutes.
5. Return wings to the refrigerator to cool for 30 minutes.
6. Preheat air fryer to 400°F.
7. Cook wings for an additional 8 minutes, shaking basket once.
8. Toss wings with buffalo sauce and serve with bleu cheese or ranch dressing and celery sticks.
