I needed something simpler than my [other pita recipe]({% post_url 2022-03-14-chewy-flatbread %}) (so I would actually make it). This is that.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup plain yogurt

### Directions

1. Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl. Add yogurt and stir until a shaggy dough forms.
1. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently until smooth, about 3 or 4 minutes. Shape into a ball, and set aside for 30 to 45 minutes.
1. Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball. Flatten and roll out each ball into a 6 inch round.
1. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook each round until bottom gets a few brown spots and starts to puff. Flip and cook until other side is browned and puffed. Transfer to a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm.
1. Serve warm, or allow to cool completely before storing in a zippered plastic bag in the refrigerator.
