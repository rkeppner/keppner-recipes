This is a cut down batch that makes only 2 crepes, which is how many I typically want. I typically fill them with [cream cheese filling](/recipes/cream-cheese-crepe-filling) and fresh berries.

### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup flour
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 pinch kosher salt
- 6 tablespoons milk
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted

### Directions

1. Add all ingredients to blender and pur√©e for 30 seconds. Let sit for 15 minutes.
2. Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Lightly coat with butter. Add half of batter and swirl to coat bottom of skillet. Cook 2-3 minutes until underside is golden brown.
3. Loosen edges with silicone spatula and quickly flip with large pancake turner. Cook 1 minute more. Slide out onto large plate.
4. Lightly coat skillet with butter again, and repeat with remaining batter.
