I haven’t had a written recipe just for rolls, so I decided to fix that. These are also great for ham sliders, especially with cranberry mustard.

### Ingredients

- 2 rounded teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1/4 cup warm water (110ºF)
- 1 cup milk
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 cups all purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1-2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 whole egg
- 1 teaspoon milk
- Coarse sea salt to taste

### Directions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water in mixer bowl. Allow yeast to become foamy (10–15 minutes).
2. Combine milk and butter in small saucepan over low heat. Cook just until butter melts. Remove from heat.
3. To yeast mixture, add 2 cups flour, honey, salt, and milk mixture. Mix on low with dough hook until no dry spots remain. Stir in flour, 2 tablespoons at a time, until dough pulls away from sides of bowl. Knead on medium for 6 minutes. Coat with olive oil, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled (90 minutes).
4. Preheat oven to 375ºF. Line a baking sheet with a baking mat.
5. Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Divide each portion into 4 more equal portions, then divide each of those into 2 further equal portions (32 total). Form each piece into a ball, pinching the seams underneath.
6. Lightly beat egg with 1 teaspoon milk.
7. Transfer dough balls onto prepared baking sheet into 4 rows of 8, close together but not touching. Brush tops lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with sea salt. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled (20–30 minutes).
8. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown (about 20 minutes).
