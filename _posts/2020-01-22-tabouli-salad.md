Yet another something I dug up for our [Christmas in Bethlehem dinner]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link_to 2019-12-25-christmas-in-bethlehem-dinner %}). This was probably the most exotic thing I served, and I may have been the only one who enjoyed it. That being said, a little goes a long way.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup bulgur wheat
- 4 firm Roma tomatoes, very finely chopped
- 1 English cucumber, very finely chopped
- 2 bunches flat-leafed parsley, most stems removed, washed, well dried, very finely chopped
- 15 fresh mint leaves, stems removed, washed, well dried, very finely chopped
- 4 scallions, very finely chopped
- salt to taste
- 4 tablespoons lemon or lime juice
- 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

### Directions

1. Wash bulgur wheat, cover with boiling water, and soak for 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly, squeezing by hand to remove excess water.
2. Drain chopped tomatoes and cucumber on paper towels.
3. Place chopped vegetables, herbs, and green onions in mixing bowl. Add bulgur and season with salt. Mix gently.
4. Add lemon or lime juice and olive oil and mix again.
5. Cover tabouli and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Serve chilled.
