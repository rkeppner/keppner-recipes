I don’t bother to make my own potstickers; it’s just too much effort. I buy them frozen from the store. But I do make my own sauce, and it’s so much better than the stuff that comes in the bag. Unfortunately, it only keeps for a week or so in the fridge, so this recipe makes just enough for a meal or two.

### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 tablespoon sugar
- 1 scallion, thinly sliced
- pinch red pepper flakes
- pinch sesame seeds, for garnish

### Directions

1. Whisk liquid ingredients and sugar together thoroughly.
2. Stir in remaining ingredients.
