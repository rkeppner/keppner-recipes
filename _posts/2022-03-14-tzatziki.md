The remaining gyros place in town seems to have closed, so I needed to find some other way to get my Greek American food fix. Luckily, my grocery store sells gyros slices, but they don’t sell the classic sauce that goes with it. So here’s a version that I can make up in small batches, as I’m the only one that eats it.

### Ingredients

- 1 English cucumber, grated
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup plain, full-fat, Greek-style yogurt
- zest and juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1 clove garlic, pressed
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh mint, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

### Directions

1. Mix grated cucumber with salt and let rest for 10 minutes.
2. Place cucumber in clean dish towel and squeeze out all the liquid possible.
3. Mix cucumber, yogurt, and remaining ingredients thoroughly.
4. Place in a covered pint jar and chill overnight. Keeps for a week or so in the refrigerator.
