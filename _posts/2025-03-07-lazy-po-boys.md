As Marti Gras came around again this year, I wanted something lighter than [gumbo]({% post_url 2024-02-13-chicken-sausage-gumbo %}) or [jambalaya]({%  post_url 2020-01-17-instant-pot-jambalaya %}). I used to eat oyster po’ boys in Provo, Utah (of all places), and I’d once had a shrimp po’ boy in Phoenix. So I decided to give it a shot, but it had to be simple and easy. This meets that requirement, taking less than 30 minutes start to finish. I wouldn’t call it authentic, but it tastes great. The shrimp was frozen from a bag, the condiments from store-bought, squeeze bottles, and instead of a baguette, I used steak rolls from Walmart.

### Ingredients

- 12 small shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 3 tablespoons all purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
- spray oil
- 2 steak rolls
- shredded lettuce
- sliced tomatoes
- sliced scallions

#### Remoulade Sauce

- 2 tablespoons tartar sauce
- 1 tablespoon horseradish sauce
- 1 teaspoon grainy mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
- 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon Louisiana hot sauce
- 1 clove garlic, minced

### Directions

1. Whisk together sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.
1. Slice roll in half and toast in air fryer at 400°F until crispy (about 3 minutes). Remove about half of the interior bread from each side.
1. Mix flour and Old Bay in a zipper sandwich bag. In a small bowl, whisk together egg and salt. In a third bowl, add panko.
1. Dredge shrimp in flour, then dip in egg, and finally coat with panko.
1. Spray shrimp with oil, and air fry at 400°F for about 8 minutes, flipping halfway through.
1. Spread sauce on both sides of roll, and layer lettuce, tomato, scallions, and shrimp. Serve immediately.

Makes 2 small sandwiches.
