Recently, the kids started requesting clam chowder. We hadn’t made it in years, but I had no objections. It’s simple and quick, and not _too_ expensive, especially since I use whole milk instead of heavy cream. It’s also great for cold days.

### Ingredients

- 4 slices bacon, chopped
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (optional)
- 2 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced
- 2 (6.5-ounce) cans minced clams
- 2 (8-ounce) bottles clam juice
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon celery seed
- 1/4 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper
- 2 cups whole milk
- Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

### Directions

1. Place bacon in a cold, heavy cooking pot. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve for later.
1. Add onion and celery to the pot with the bacon drippings. Cook and stir until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
1. If using flour, sprinkle it over the onion and celery mixture and stir to coat. Cook for about 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.
1. Drain the juice from the clams into the pot, reserving the clams themselves. Deglaze the pot by scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Stir well to combine with the drippings.
1. Add the diced potatoes, bottled clam juice, salt, thyme, celery seed, Old Bay seasoning, and black pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
1. Stir in the reserved clams and milk. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Do not boil.
1. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
1. Remove from heat and let the chowder sit for a few minutes to thicken slightly
1. Serve hot, garnished with the reserved bacon and fresh parsley (if using).
