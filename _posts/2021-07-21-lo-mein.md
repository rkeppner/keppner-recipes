Chinese soft noodles with vegetables and sauce. Kind of like fried rice, only with noodles.

### Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons cooking oil
- 2 tablespoons fresh ginger, cut into thin julienne
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 chicken breast, sliced bite-sized
- 2-3 cups fresh asian noodles (or previously cooked noodles, cooled and air dried)
- 1/2 pound green cabbage, sliced
- 1 large carrot, julienned
- 3 scallions, cut into 1/2 inch bias slices

#### Sauce Ingredients

- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 6 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil

### Directions

1. Whisk all sauce ingredients together. Set aside.
2. Heat pan over high heat. Add cooking oil. When white smoke begins to appear, add ginger and garlic, stirring constantly until garlic softens.
3. Add chicken and stir fry until mostly cooked.
4. Add cabbage and carrots, continuing to stir fry for about 1 minute.
5. Stir in noodles. Stir sauce and add to pan. Toss everything with tongs to mix thoroughly.
6. Continue to stir fry until sauce thickens. Remove from heat.
7. Garnish with scallions. Serve.
