Recently I’ve been getting a lot of my protein from boneless, skinless chicken breast, as well as experimenting with the air fryer. This seemed like a perfect pairing of both, while thoroughly satisfying my crispy fried cravings.

### Ingredients

- 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast
- Corn starch to coat all surfaces
- 1 whole egg, salted and beaten
- Panko bread crumbs to coat all sides
- Cooking spray
- 1 cup green cabbage, shredded

#### Tonkatsu Sauce Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons sucralose
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup ketchup
- 1 tablespoon ground sesame seeds (optional)
- 1/4 teaspoon hot mustard (optional)

#### Sesame Dressing Ingredients

- 1/4 cup reduced fat mayonaise
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons ground sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon mirin
- 1 tablespoon sucralose

### Directions

1. Soak shredded cabbage in ice water for 10 minutes to crisp. Drain in colander.
2. Whisk sauce ingredients together. Set aside.
3. Whisk dressing ingredients together. Set aside.
4. Butterfly chicken breast flat-ways into 2 equal cutlets. Tenderize each side of the chicken by lightly beating it with the back of the knife.
5. Coat all sides of chicken with corn starch. Dip chicken in egg wash. Generously coat chicken in panko.
6. Transfer chicken to air fryer basket preheated to 350ºF. Spray chicken lightly with cooking spray.
7. Cook for 9 minutes. Flip chicken and lightly spray the other side with cooking spray. Cook for an additional 9 minutes.
8. Remove chicken to cutting board and slice into half inch strips across the grain. Serve with tonkatsu sauce, cabbage with dressing, and steamed rice.
