This is our go-to recipe for basic cookies.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups sugar
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- 1 cup shortening
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 3 cups instant oats
- 1 cup chocolate chips or raisins (optional)
- 1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease baking sheet.
2. Cream together sugar, molasses, and shortening. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well.
3. Sift together flour, salt, and soda. Slowly add to wet ingredients, and mix in.
4. Add oats and mix in. If using, and chocolate chips, raisins and/or nuts, and stir in.
5. Drop in tablespoons onto prepared baking sheet, and arrange evenly. Bake until lightly golden, about 5–8 minutes. Do not over-bake; they will look slightly raw.
6. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.
