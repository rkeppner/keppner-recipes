When I want something different on pizza night, I whip this up for myself while my kids eat their weekly crap I get from Little Caesars. I usually buy pre-made pizza dough, but when I forget, I sometimes even make my own.

### Ingredients

- Dark meat from a rotisserie chicken, shredded
- Buffalo sauce
- 4 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon cilantro leaves (optional)
- Olive oil, for greasing bowl and baking sheet

#### Crust

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon instant yeast
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3/4 cup warm water

#### Sauce

- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- large pinch salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons gorgonzola cheese, crumbled

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 550°F.
1. In a food processor, combine flour, salt, sugar, yeast, olive oil, and warm water. Process for about 30 seconds, until a ball forms. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover dough with a little more oil, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
1. Toss shredded chicken with buffalo sauce to taste. Set aside.
1. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, milk, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and gorgonzola cheese. Stir until smooth, smashing the gorgonzola into the mixture. Set aside.
1. Deflate the risen dough. If making individual pizzas, divide dough into 2 equal pieces. Spread out each piece by hand on a floured surface to desired size and thickness. Transfer to a steel baking sheet.
1. Spread a thin layer of sauce over the crust, then top with shredded chicken, scallions, and mozzarella cheese.
1. Bake on bottom rack for 8–10 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and crust shows char spots on bottom.
1. Remove pizza from oven to cooling rack. Let cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
1. Garnish with cilantro leaves, if using.

Make 1 large or 2 individual pizzas.
