I’m a big fan of enchiladas, but none of the canned sauces I’ve tried came anywhere close to what I can get in local restaurants. When I researched how to make my own, I learned that enchilada sauce isn’t really native to Mexico, it’s Tex-Mex. It’s what happens when you take Southern-style gravy and add chili powder to it. It’s chili gravy!

The problem now is, since I made the first batch at home, I can’t stand the thought of buying the canned stuff, and I don’t think anybody here would let me any more, so I’m stuck making it by hand every time we need some. Luckily, it doesn’t really take very long to make.

### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup lard (or vegetable oil, though I don’t care for it that way)
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon granulated onion
- 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning (Emeril’s Essence or similar)
- 4 cups chicken broth (homemade stock is awesome, from bouillon is fine)
- additional salt to taste

### Directions

1. Melt lard in large saucepan.
2. Add flour, and whisk to make a roux. Cook until blonde.
3. Turn heat to low, and whisk in spices.
4. Stir in broth, and return heat to medium. Whisk until fully thickened.
5. Adjust seasoning, if necessary.
6. Serve hot over enchiladas or chile rellenos.
