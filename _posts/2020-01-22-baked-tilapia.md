I'm not a big fish lover, but occasionally I serve it to the family. This is the simplest thing I've ever found. I just grab a big bag of individually frozen tilapia fillets and cook up the whole thing.

### Ingredients

- tilapia fillets
- lemon pepper seasoning

### Directions

1. Line a baking sheet with foil. Spray with non-stick spray.
2. Arrange the fillets in a single layer. Top with seasoning.
3. Bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for 15 minutes or until the fish is white.
4. Serve with favorite sides.
