My wife has been a big fan of this type of soup for a long time, but this is only the first or second time I’ve attempted to make it for her myself. Fortunately, it turned out so well that I had to record the recipe for the future. To make it fancier, you can leave out the sour cream and cheese and instead add these as a garnish in individual bowl, along with a small sprig of cilantro.

### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup chicken fat (or oil)
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 medium red bell pepper, diced (optional)
- 1 cup whole kernel corn
- 1 cup black beans, cooked and drained
- 1/4 cup (1 can) green chili peppers, chopped
- 2 cups cooked chicken, diced
- 1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano, crushed
- 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
- 2 quarts chicken stock
- 1 1/2 cups green enchilada sauce
- juice of 1 lime
- salt to taste
- 12 corn tortillas, sliced into thin strips
- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 cups shredded pepper jack cheese (optional)

### Directions

1. Heat chicken fat (or oil) in large heavy cooking pot.
2. Add onion and red pepper, and sauté until onion is translucent.
3. Add corn, beans, green chilis, chicken, oregano, and pepper, and heat through.
4. Add chicken stock, enchilada sauce, and lime juice. Salt to taste.
5. Bring soup to simmer, and add tortilla strips. Cook until tortillas are softened.
6. Remove from heat, and stir in sour cream and cheese.
7. Serve immediately.
