I love the fruit pizza concept in all of its variations, and this version is the right size for a summer treat to use up an evening’s raspberry picking.

### Ingredients

- 1/3 cup margarine, softened
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 egg yolk, room temperature
- 1/2 tablespoon whole milk, room temperature
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- pinch salt
- 1–2 cups fresh raspberries (or other fruit)

#### Cream Cheese Frosting

- 1/4 cup margarine, softened
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 8 ounces powdered sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease an 6x9 sheet pan.
1. For cookie crust, in a large bowl, cream together the margarine, sugar, and vanilla thoroughly. Beat in the egg until light and fluffy. Mix in the milk.
1. Sift in flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix until just combined.
1. Flatten the dough between 2 sheets of wax paper. Freeze for 20 minutes. Press the dough into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly.
1. Bake until crust is golden brown, but not overly crisp (about 15-20 minutes). Remove from oven and let cool completely in the pan.
1. For cream cheese frosting, beat margarine and cream cheese until smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until fluffy. Spread evenly over the cooled crust.
1. Top with fresh raspberries, pressing them gently into the frosting.
1. Cut into squares or rectangles to serve. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.
