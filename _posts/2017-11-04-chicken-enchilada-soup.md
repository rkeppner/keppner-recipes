My wife has been a big fan of this type of soup for a long time, but this is only the first or second time I’ve attempted to make it for her myself. Fortunately, it turned out so well that I had to record the recipe for the future. To make it fancier, you can garnish it with sour cream, grated cheese, diced avocado, tortilla chips, and/or chopped fresh cilantro.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 clove garlic, minced
- 1 cup fresh zucchini, diced
- 2 cups frozen whole kernel corn
- 2 14-ounce cans black beans, drained
- 1 28-ounce can Ro*Tel Original tomatoes and green chilies
- 2 cups cooked chicken, diced
- 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano, crushed
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 3 quarts chicken stock
- 1 28-ounce can red enchilada sauce
- juice of 1 lime
- salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Heat oil in large heavy cooking pot.
2. Add onion, garlic, and (optional) zucchini, and sauté until onion is translucent.
3. Add corn, beans, Ro*Tel, chicken, oregano, and cumin, and heat through.
4. Add chicken stock, enchilada sauce, and lime juice. Salt and pepper to taste.
5. Bring soup to simmer, and remove from heat.
7. Serve immediately, with optional garnishes.
