This is by far my favorite way to use up overripe bananas. If you have a 13x18" baking sheet, you can double this recipe to use it.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon molases
- 1 cup very ripe bananas (about 4), mashed
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

#### Frosting Ingredients

- 8 ounces cream cheese (1 package), softened
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup powdered sugar

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat 9x13" baking sheet with cooking spray, and set aside.
2. Combine sugar, molasses, banana, vanilla, oil, and eggs, and beat well to combine.
3. Stir in flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt, just until combined. Pour batter into prepared baking sheet, and spread into even layer with silicone spatula.
4. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Cool completely on rack.
5. While bars are cooling, beat cream cheese, butter, and vanilla on medium-high speed until smooth (about 2 minutes).
6. Reduce speed to low, and gradually add powdered sugar. Increase speed to high, and beat for 1-2 minutes.
7. Gently spread frosting evenly over cooled bars. Slice and serve.
