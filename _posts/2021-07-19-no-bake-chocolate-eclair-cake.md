This is one of my go-tos in the summer when it gets too hot to turn the oven on. It does take a while to chill, though.

### Ingredients

- 1 16-ounce package whipped topping
- 2 3.4-ounce boxes instant vanilla pudding
- 3 cups milk
- 1 box graham crackers (3 sleeves)

#### Topping Ingredients

- 1/3 cup cocoa powder
- 1 cup sugar
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla

### Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine 3 cups milk and pudding. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes.
2. Fold whipped topping into pudding mixture. Stir until well combined.
3. Cover the entire bottom of a 9x13 in dish with a layer of graham crackers (1 sleeve).
4. Pour half of pudding mixture over bottom graham cracker layer. Use spatula to spread evenly.
5. Repeat with second layer of graham crackers and remaining pudding mixture.
6. Add final layer of graham crackers on top.
7. In small saucepan, add cocoa, sugar, and milk. Bring to a full, rolling boil. Boil for 1 minute, whisking constantly.
8. Remove saucepan from heat and let cool for 1 minute, while continuing to whisk.
9. Add butter and vanilla, whisking until butter is melted and a smooth glaze forms.
10. Immediately pour chocolate glaze onto top layer of graham crackers. Tilt dish as needed to cover entire top.
11. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours.
