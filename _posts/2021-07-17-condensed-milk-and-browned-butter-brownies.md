I got this recipe from Adam Ragusea (my current favorite YouTube cooking channel), but I haven't yet decided if they're worth the effort. The taste and texture are absolutely fabulous, but working with the condensed milk is a complete nightmare. I guess as long as you don't mind an upper-body workout and 20 minutes of cleanup, it's not that bad...

### Ingredients

- 3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) butter
- 1 1/2 cups cocoa powder
- 3 14-ounce cans sweetened condensed milk
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons vanilla
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- scant teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 egg yolks
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Melt butter in mid-sized pot over medium heat. Continue heating until the water boils out, stirring to keep milk solids from sticking to the bottom.
3. When butter begins to brown, whisk in cocoa powder. Let it boil for a minute, then remove from heat.
4. Whisk in sweetened condensed milk, then powdered sugar until dissolved. Whisk in salt, vanilla, molasses, and egg yolks. Whisk in flour.
5. Scrape batter into baking sheet. Spread roughly with spatula. Bake 30-40 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out not-quite clean. Let cool thoroughly before cutting.
