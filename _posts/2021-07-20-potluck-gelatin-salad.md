When I want to bring something sweet to a potluck lunch but I don't want to put much effort into it, this is a great option. However, it really does need about 4 hours of chill time to work correctly.

### Ingredients

- 2 3-ounce packages of gelatin dessert
- 1 24-ounce package cottage cheese
- 1 16-ounce package whipped topping
- 2 20-ounce cans crushed pineapple, drained

### Directions

1. In a large bowl, mix gelatin dessert powder with cottage cheese.
2. Gently fold in whipped topping until thoroughly combined.
3. Add crushed pineapple and mix well.
4. Place in 9x13 inch pan. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours (8-12 is better).
