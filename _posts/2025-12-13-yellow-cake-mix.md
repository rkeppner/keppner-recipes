I got tired of having to buy a boxed yellow cake mix to make my [Pumpkin Pie Dump Cake]({% post_url 2022-03-19-pumpkin-pie-dump-cake %}), so I came up with something I can mix from scratch. And it gets rid of that weird smell that boxed cake mixes have.

### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups minus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour (156 grams)
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons corn starch
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Whisk together until thoroughly mixed.
