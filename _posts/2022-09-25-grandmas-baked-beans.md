These are one of my favorites at family pot luck dinners, so I finally had to get the recipe so I could make them myself, should I need to. Mom calls them “Lion House Baked Beans” and uses granulated onion and garlic, but I still think of them as hers.

### Ingredients

- 4 cans (15 ounce) pork and beans, drained
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 1 bell pepper, finely diced
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 cup ketchup
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- 1 tablespoon worchestershire sauce
- 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional)
- 1 pound bacon, cooked and crumbled

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325ºF.
2. Mix all ingredients except bacon in 9x13 baking dish.
3. Top with bacon, and cover dish with foil. Bake for 90 minutes.
4. Remove foil and return to oven for an additional 30 minutes.
5. Let rest for 15 minutes and serve.
