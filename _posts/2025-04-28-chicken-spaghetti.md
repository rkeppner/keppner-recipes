My youngest daughter requested this dish for dinner for her birthday, so I figured I’d better get the recipe recorded. It used to be a regular in our house, but I haven’t made it in years. It’s our variation of the [Pioneer Woman recipe](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a11729/chicken-spaghetti-recipe/), based on our family’s tastes and my preferences for ease of preparation. I usually start with a rotisserie chicken, remove all of the meat, and then simmer everything else remaining in a large saucepan to make the broth for the pasta.

### Ingredients

- 4 cups chicken broth
- 12 ounces spaghetti, broken into fourths
- 2 10.5-ounce cans cream of chicken soup
- 8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, grated (about 3 cups)
- 2 cups cooked (rotisserie) chicken, shredded
- 1/2 cup onion, finely diced
- 1 teaspoon Lawry’s seasoning salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cajun seasoning
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 ounces cooked bacon, crumbled

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
1. Cook spaghetti in chicken broth until not quite al dente. Remove pasta and reserve broth.
1. In large bowl, combine soup, 2 cups of shredded cheese, chicken, onion, seasoning salt, and cajun seasoning. Stir to combine.
1. Add cooked spaghetti and 2 cups of reserved broth to soup mixture. Stir to combine.
1. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
1. Pour into 9x13 baking dish and top with remaining cheese and bacon.
1. Bake for 45 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
1. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
