This is my favorite potato salad recipe, and using the Instant Pot makes it a bit quicker. The addition of the vinegar makes it somewhat like a German potato salad.

### Ingredients

- 3 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes
- 3 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar, divided (apple cider vinegar will also work)
- 2 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 4 cups cold water

#### Dressing Ingredients

- 3 eggs, hard boiled and finely chopped
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 1/2 cup dill pickles, finely chopped
- 3 stalks celery, finely diced
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped (or 1/2 tablespoon dried)
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard
- 1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Add salt, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and water to Instant Pot. Add potato cubes and submerge. Place eggs on potatoes. Use the _manual_ function set for 0 minutes, followed by an immediate quick release. Remove the boiled eggs to cold water, and gently drain the potatoes in a colander.
2. Gently spread the hot potato cubes on a large tray. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons vinegar. Let cool for 30 minutes. Chop eggs as soon as cool.
3. Combine all dressing ingredients in large bowl. When potatoes are cool, gently fold in, just until fully combined. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours.
