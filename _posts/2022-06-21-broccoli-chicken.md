This has become a weekly staple for me because itâ€™s cheap, easy, and low calorie because of its low fat content.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 1 carrot, peeled and sliced
- 1/2 boneless, skinless chicken breast, sliced thinly

#### Marinade Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon rice wine
- 1 egg white
- 1 scant tablespoon corn starch

#### Sauce Ingredients

- 2/3 cup chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons sucralose
- 2 clove garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, crushed
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- drizzle sesame oil

### Directions

1. Whisk marinade ingredients together. Toss chicken in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
2. Whisk all sauce ingredients together. Set aside.
3. Bring a pot of water to a low boil. Blanch carrots in boiling water; remove with slotted spoon and set aside. Repeat for broccoli.
4. Add chicken mixture to boiling water. Stir gently to distribute. Cook for a minute or 2, with occasional, gentle agitation to keep it from sticking together but without removing velveting. Remove from water.
5. Heat frying pan over medium high heat. Spray with cooking spray. Add sauce mixture; when it reaches a simmer, add chicken and vegetables.
6. Stir fry until sauce thickens. Remove from heat, and serve with steamed rice.
