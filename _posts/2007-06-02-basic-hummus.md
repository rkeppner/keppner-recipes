Now that I’ve pretty much switched to a “slow-carb-style” diet, I’ve wanted something to give raw vegetables some flavor. I’ve enjoyed hummus for years, but usually on pita bread, which I’m not eating right now. Like most of my recipes, I arrived at this one by combining the aspects I liked from a number of recipes found while searching Google.

### Ingredients

- 3 cups garbanzo beans, cooked and hulled (or 2 15-oz. cans, drained and rinsed)
- 2/3 cup tahini (roasted, not raw)
- 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 cup cooking liquid from garbanzo beans (or water, if not available)
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- pinch cayenne pepper

### Directions

1. Place all ingredients in food processor and process until smooth and creamy.
2. Spoon into serving dish and garnish with any combination of olive oil, paprika, parsley, and/or tomatoes.
3. Serve at room temperature or chilled with fresh vegetables, such as carrot sticks, celery sticks, cucumber slices, broccoli flowerets, cauliflower flowerets, or sugar peas.
