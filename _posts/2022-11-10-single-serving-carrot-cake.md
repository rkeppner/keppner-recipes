I really like carrot cake, but Iâ€™m just not much of a baker. The time it takes to make cake typically means I only do so once or twice a year. However, this recipe allows me to make a treat in about 15 minutes. Mmm, cake!

*Note: This recipe is for a single serving. If you want to make a regular, 2-layer cake, multiply the ingredients by 12 and double the frosting.*

### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil [1/3 cup]
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar [1/2 cup]
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract [1 teaspoon]
- 1 1/2 tablespoons buttermilk [3/4 cup]
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour [1 cup]
- 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice [2 teaspoons]
- 1/8 teaspoon baking powder [1 teaspoon]
- pinch salt [1/2 teaspoon]
- 1 tablespoon carrot, grated [1/2 cup]
- 1 tablespoon crushed pineapple, drained (optional) [1/2 cup]
- 1/2 tablespoon raisins (about 6) [1/4 cup]
- 1/2 tablespoon chopped pecans or walnuts [1/4 cup]

#### Cream Cheese Frosting (not single serving)

- 4 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
- 4 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
- 8 ounces powdered sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Directions

1. Place butter in custard cup or small ramekin. Cover and microwave on low until melted.
2. Add brown sugar, vanilla, milk, flour, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Whisk with fork until thoroughly combined.
3. Fold in carrot, pineapple (if using), raisins, and nuts.
4. Microwave on high for 1 minute and 15 seconds. Allow to cool completely.
5. For cream cheese frosting, beat butter and cream cheese until smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until fluffy.
