I really like carrot cake, but I’m just not much of a baker. The time it takes to make cake typically means I only do so once or twice a year. However, this recipe allows me to make a treat in about 15 minutes. Mmm, cake!

### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons butter
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 tablespoons milk
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- 1/8 teaspoon baking powder
- pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon carrot, finely shredded
- 1/2 tablespoon raisins (about 6)
- 1/2 tablespoon chopped pecans or walnuts

### Directions

1. Place butter in custard cup or small ramekin. Cover and microwave on low until melted.
2. Add brown sugar, vanilla, milk, flour, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Whisk with fork until thoroughly combined.
3. Fold in carrot, raisins, and nuts.
4. Microwave on high for 1 minute and 15 seconds. Allow to cool completely.
5. If desired, top with whipped cream or cream cheese frosting.
