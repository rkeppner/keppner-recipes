After finding that I could make myself [carrot cake]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-11-10-single-serving-carrot-cake %}) in 15 minutes, I decided I needed to do the same for a brownie. Dessert for one is awesome! Just double it if your significant other can have some, too.

This isn’t nearly as good as [my regular brownies]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-09-27-classic-brownies %}), but it’s a much better option for a quick chocolate fix, especially with a scoop of ice cream.

### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons butter
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon chocolate chips
- 1 tablespoon chopped pecans or walnuts

### Directions

1. Place butter in custard cup or small ramekin. Cover and microwave on low until melted.
2. Add brown sugar, vanilla, milk, flour, and salt. Whisk with fork until combined.
3. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts.
4. Microwave on high for 1 minute and 15 seconds. Allow to cool completely.
5. If desired, top with whipped cream or ice cream.
