After finding that I could make myself [carrot cake]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-11-10-single-serving-carrot-cake %}) in 15 minutes, I decided I needed to do the same for a brownie. Dessert for one is awesome! Just double it if your significant other can have some, too.

This isn’t nearly as good as [my regular brownies]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-09-27-classic-brownies %}), but it’s a much better option for a quick chocolate fix, especially with a scoop of ice cream.

### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons butter
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon cocoa powder
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons buttermilk
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- pinch baking powder
- pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon chocolate chips
- 1 tablespoon chopped pecans or walnuts

### Directions

1. Preheat air fryer to 350ºF.
2. Place butter in custard cup or small ramekin. Cover and microwave on low until melted.
3. Add brown sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, milk, flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk with fork until combined.
4. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts.
5. Microwave on high for 30 seconds. Transfer to preheated air fryer for 10 minutes. Allow to cool completely.
6. If desired, top with vanilla ice cream and/or caramel syrup.
