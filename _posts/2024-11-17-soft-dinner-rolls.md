My daughter-in-law makes these rolls for many of our family dinners. Since they can’t be with us this Thanksgiving, I asked for the recipe so we can still have them. However, I changed the proportions to fill a full sheet pan instead of a 9x13 pan, and I’ll probably make 2 of those. They’re so good!

### Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups warm milk (110°F)
- 1 stick unsalted butter, melted
- 1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 6 cups all-purpose flour
- Kosher salt to sprinkle on top (optional)

### Directions

1. In mixer bowl with dough hook, stir together warm milk and 2 tablespoons sugar. Sprinkle yeast over top and let sit until foamy (5–10 minutes).
2. Add remaining sugar, salt, and 6 tablespoons of the melted butter. With mixer on low, add flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough pulls away from sides of bowl. The dough should feel sticky and tacky but should not stick to clean, dry finger tips.
3. Knead on medium for 2 minutes. Transfer dough to a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled (about 2 hours).
4. Preheat oven to lowest setting. Grease a full sheet pan. Turn off oven.
5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and divide into 24 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a greased full sheet pan. Cover and let rise in warm oven until doubled (30 to 60 minutes). Do not over-proof.
6. Remove rolls from oven and cover from rolls. Preheat oven to 375°F.
7. Bake rolls until golden brown and crispy (about 25 minutes). Remove and brush with melted butter. Sprinkle with kosher salt, if desired. Let cool slightly before serving.
