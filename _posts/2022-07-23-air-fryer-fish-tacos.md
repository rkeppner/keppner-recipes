With the success of my [Chicken Katsu recipe]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-06-20-air-fryer-chicken-katsu %}), I thought I’d give fish tacos a try. I love them, but the nearest place to get what I like is 45 minutes away from home, and deep fried fish isn’t ideal for my diet anyway. Luckily, these turned out fantastic!

### Ingredients

- 1 tilapia fillet (4 ounces)
- Flour to coat all surfaces
- 1 whole egg, salted and beaten
- Panko bread crumbs to coat all sides
- Cooking spray
- 4 corn tortillas
- 1/2 cup green cabbage, shredded
- 1/4 cup pico de gallo
- taco sauce

#### White Sauce Dressing Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon reduced fat mayonaise
- 1 tablespoon fat free plain greek yogurt
- 1 teaspoon lime juice
- 1 teaspoon sucralose
- pinch garlic
- pinch cajun seasoning
- salt to taste

### Directions

1. Whisk white sauce ingredients together. Set aside.
2. Place flour, egg, and panko on separate plates. Cut tilapia fillet lengthwise into equal portions. Salt both sides well. Coat all sides of tilapia with flour, dip in egg wash, and generously coat in panko.
3. Transfer tilapia to air fryer basket preheated to 400ºF. Spray fillets lightly with cooking spray.
4. Cook for 5 minutes. Flip tilapia and lightly spray the other side with cooking spray. Cook for an additional 5 minutes.
5. While tilapia is cooking, heat individual corn tortillas in a dry pan over medium heat until blistered and leathery. Store covered together to keep warm.
8. Place each fillet over 2 overlapping tortillas with shredded cabbage, white sauce, taco sauce, and pico de gallo. Serve with fresh lime wedges.
