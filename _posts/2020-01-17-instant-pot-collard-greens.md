For some strange reason, I actually _like_ greens, and when I was looking for something to go with our New Year [jambalaya]({% post_url 2020-01-17-instant-pot-jambalaya %}), it had to be collard greens. The key to good, Southern-style greens is lots and lots of fatty pork, and we all know _bacon_ is the world's best fatty pork.

### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 3 slices extra thick, uncooked bacon, chopped
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 3/4 cup chicken broth
- 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 16 ounces collard greens, rinsed and roughly chopped

### Directions

1. Remove as much of the thick, center stem from the collard greens as possible.
2. Heat the olive oil in the Instant Pot with the _sauté_ function. Add the bacon and sauté for 4-5 minutes. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is golden.
3. Deglaze the pot with about 1/3 cup of the chicken broth. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any food sticking to the pan and stir.
4. Add the remaining broth, vinegar, sugar, and pepper flakes, stirring to combine.
5. Add the collard greens, packing them down below the maximum fill line.
6. Use the _manual_ function to cook on maximum pressure for 5 minutes.
7. After cooking completes, allow pressure to natural release for 10 or 15 minutes, then manually release any remaining pressure.
8. Stir and serve warm.
