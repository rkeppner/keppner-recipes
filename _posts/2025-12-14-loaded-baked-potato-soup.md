I’ve taught most of my kids to make this soup, but I’ve never really written down the recipe. This corrects that problem.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 6 ounces bacon bits
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- 1/2 tablespoon steak seasoning
- 2 quarts chicken stock
- 3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut in 1/2 inch cubes
- 3 tablespoons chicken bouillon powder
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 quart cream or whole milk or combination
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Sliced scallions, grated cheddar cheese, and sour cream for garnish
- Oyster crackers (optional)

### Directions

1. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the bacon bits, and cook until crispy. Remove bacon bits with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat in the pot.
1. Add the diced onion to the pot and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.
1. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and stir well to combine. Cook for 2-3 minutes to eliminate the raw flour taste. Add the Cajun and steak seasonings, stirring to combine. Fry until fragrant, about 1 minute.
1. Gradually whisk in the chicken stock, ensuring there are no lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
1. Add the cubed potatoes, chicken bouillon powder, and soy sauce. Simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes.
1. Add the cream or milk, stirring to combine. Bring the soup back to a gentle simmer, without boiling.
1. Remove from heat, and stir bacon bits back into the soup. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
1. Serve hot, garnished with sliced scallions, grated cheddar cheese, sour cream, and oyster crackers (if desired).
