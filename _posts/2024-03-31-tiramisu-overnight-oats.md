When I got tired of eating All-Bran Buds with fruit every day for breakfast, I moved to this high protien alternative.

### Ingredients

- 50g instant oats (optionally toasted and/or gound in blender)
- 150g nonfat plain Greek yogurt
- 15g chocolate protein powder
- 3 tablespoons sugar substitute
- 1 tablespoon Pero instant coffee substitute
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon ground psyllium husk powder
- 4g (1 teaspoon) vanilla extract
- 250g water
- 1g (1/4 teaspoon) salt

### Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well.
2. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
3. The following morning, optionally stir in fresh fruit or nuts.
