Adapted to a portion of two, for when I want a quick treat.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons corn syrup
- 2 tablespoons granulated sucralose
- 2 tablespoons peanut butter
- 1 cup cereal

### Directions

1. In a glass bowl, combine corn syrup and sucralose. Microwave on high for 30 seconds. Stir to dissolve sucralose. Microwave until mixture boils for 1 minute.
1. Stir in peanut butter until smooth.
1. Add cereal and stir until evenly coated. Press mixture into a greased ramekin, and let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Cut into portion-sized pieces and serve.
