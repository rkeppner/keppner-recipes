I _almost never_ deep fat fry anything at home. It’s just not worth the effort and mess. But I do like doughnuts. So I searched around until I found something that would work in the air fryer. They're far from gourmet, but they're quick and easy, and my youngest daughter even told me that they were better than what I usually get from the grocery store bakery.

### Ingredients

- 1 package large, flaky biscuits (8 count)
- 1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted (optional)

#### Glaze

- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1-2 tablespoons milk
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Directions

1. Preheat air fryer to 350ºF.
2. Mix the glaze ingredients together in a small bowl, and set aside.
3. Open the can of biscuits and separate them, evening out the edges and thickness.
4. Cut a hole in the center of each biscuit with a 1 inch cookie cutter.
5. Place 4 of the doughnuts into the air fryer basket. If using, brush with butter.
6. Air fry for 3 minutes, then flip them over. Optionally butter the other side.
7. Air fry for an additional 3 minutes, or until golden brown.
8. Allow them to cool just enough to handle, then dip in the glaze.
9. Drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
10. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts and holes.
11. Serve warm. As they cool, they will become more dense and chewy. However, they can be reheated in the microwave for 5-10 seconds to soften them up again.
