When I began making my own gyros, I decided that I couldnâ€™t put up with the store bought pitas for them anymore. After trying a few different recipes online, this is the one I landed on. This, along with [tzatziki sauce]({% post_url 2022-03-14-tzatziki %}) and store-bought gyros slices makes a really good combination.

### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
- 1 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

### Directions

1. Add 1/2 cup flour, yeast, and sugar to mixing bowl. Add water and whisk for 2 or 3 minutes to combine thoroughly. Cover bowl and let sit for 30 to 60 minutes, until bubbly. Add salt, olive oil, and remaining flour. Mix together until it forms a dough ball that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
2. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for about 2 minutes, until dough is soft and slightly elastic.
3. Place dough in a clean bowl and coat lightly with olive oil. Cover bowl and let dough rise in a warm spot until doubled in size (60 to 90 minutes). Knead to remove gas bubbles. Place in a zippered plastic bag, and refregerate overnight.
4. Divide dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball. Flatten and roll out each ball as thin as possible without tearing it, then stretch it out by hand even thinner.
5. In a dry, cast iron skillet preheated over high heat, cook each disk until blisters form and it begins to brown, about 45 to 60 seconds per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with an inverted bowl to allow it to steam. Repeat until all portions are cooked.
6. If not eating immediately, allow to cool completely before storing in a zippered plastic bag in the refrigerator.
