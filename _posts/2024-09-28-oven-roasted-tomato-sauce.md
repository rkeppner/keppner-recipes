My mother and sister swear by this recipe. I’m just exstatic that it doesn’t require me to peel the tomatoes. Peeling tomatoes sucks. And peaches. Removing thin skin from soft fruit is awful, and having to dip them in boiling water to do so is even worse. Good ridance!

### Ingredients

- 2 pounds tomatoes, cut in half
- 1 large onion, chopped (optional)
- 1 large bell pepper, chopped (optional)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- Hendful fresh basil (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Pour olive oil on large baking sheet and spread over entire surface.
3. Sprinkle the garlic, herbs, sugar, salt, and pepper evenly over the oil.
4. Place the tomatoes cut side down on the oil. Add the onion and bell pepper if using.
5. Roast for 30 minutes. Add the basil if using. Roast for another 10 minutes.
6. Remove from oven and let cool until just warm.
7. Scrape everything into a food processor, and blend until desired consistency is reached.
8. Cool completely and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 6 months.
