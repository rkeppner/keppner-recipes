I was feeling creative this weekend. I wanted chicken pizza, but I also wanted Greek food, so I just decided to mix the two. Since I’m still following a slow-carb diet, I used a whole wheat low-carb tortilla instead of the pita, which wasn’t bad. Leave a comment and let me know what you think.

### Ingredients

- 1 - 1 1/2 pounds fresh chicken, cubed (I used boneless skinless thighs)
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 tablespoon dried oregano
- pinch dried mint leaf
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
- 1 medium onion, sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
- 4 pieces whole wheat pita bread (I get mine at Trader Joe’s)
- 8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup kalamata olives, sliced
- 4 ounces crumbled feta cheese
- 2 roma tomatoes, cored and diced

### Directions

1. Place olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, mint, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Let sit while preparing chicken.
2. Cube chicken and add to marinade mixture. Let sit for 1 to 2 hours.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in skillet, then add chicken mixture. Fry until liquid is absorbed. Remove chicken with slotted spoon, leaving oil in pan.
4. Sauté onion and pepper in oil until translucent.
5. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
6. Lightly brush pitas with olive oil. Top with mozzarella, onions and peppers, chicken souvlaki, olives, feta, and tomatoes.
7. Bake on pizza stone until lightly browned, about 20 minutes.

To round out the meal, serve with crudités and [hummus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2007-06-02-basic-hummus %}).
