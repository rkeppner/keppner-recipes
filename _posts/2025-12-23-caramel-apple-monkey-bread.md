Yet another sickly sweet breakfast casserole that we make during the holidays. This one is sure to add a few pounds, but it might just be worth it.

### Ingredients

- 2 cans jumbo refrigerated cinnamon rolls
- 1/4 cup margarine, melted
- 1 can apple pie filling
- 1/2 container caramel dip (about 8 ounces)
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1-1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon, separated
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
1. Cut each cinnamon roll into 1-inch pieces (about 6 per roll). Reserve icing.
1. In a 9x13-inch casserole dish, toss cinnamon roll pieces in melted margarine until coated. Spread evenly in dish.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, vanilla, and salt. Pour over cinnamon roll pieces.
1. Evenly distribute apple pie filling over the top.
1. Warm caramel dip in microwave to soften. Drizzle over cinnamon roll pieces. If using, sprinkle chopped pecans evenly over top.
1. Bake uncovered for 30-40 minutes, or until top is golden and crisp. Let stand for 10 minutes to cool slightly.
1. Mix reserved icing with remaining 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. Drizzle over warm casserole before serving.
