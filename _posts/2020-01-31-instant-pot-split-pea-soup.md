This is truly comfort food on a cold winter evening. And with the Instant Pot, the whole thing can be done in an hour.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 4 bay leaves
- 4 carrots, peeled and chopped
- 2 ribs celery, sliced
- 12 cups chicken stock
- 2 pounds split peas
- 3 pounds smoked pork shanks

### Directions

1. Melt butter in pot on _sauté_ setting. Add onion and sauté until softened.
2. Add garlic, salt, thyme, and bay leaves. Continue to sauté for another minute. Add carrots and celery and sauté for an additional minute.
3. Deglaze the pot with 1/2 cup stock.
4. Add split peas, pork shanks, and remaining stock. Use the _manual_ function to cook on maximum pressure for 15 minutes.
5. After cooking completes, allow pressure to natural release for 15 minutes, then manually release any remaining pressure.
6. Remove pork shanks and set aside. Remove bay leaves and discard. Give soup a few quick stirs to thicken. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove meat from pork shanks, chop, and stir back into soup.
7. Serve warm.
