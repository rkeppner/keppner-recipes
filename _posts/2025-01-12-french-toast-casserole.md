We used to make this all the time, but when I was recently asked to bring it to a “breakfast for supper” family meal, I couldn’t come up with the recipe. I found one online that was as close as I could remember, and tweaked it just a bit. At least now I know where to find it!

This make a large batch that will feed a crowd. I make it in a 12x18 inch roasting pan. It’s great for a brunch or potluck.

### Ingredients

- 8–16 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1 loaf French bread, cut into 1-inch slices (or Texas toast)
- 1 cup blueberries (optional)
- 12 large eggs
- 3 cups milk
- 3/4 cup real maple syrup (or 1 cup of the fake stuff)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease a 12x18 inch roasting pan.
1. Spread cream cheese over one side of each slice of bread. Cut slices into 1-inch cubes.
1. If using blueberries, sprinkle them over the bread cubes and gently toss to distribute. Arrange in even layer in roasting pan.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, syrup, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Pour over bread. Press bread down gently with a spatula to make sure all the bread is soaked. Let sit for at least 20 minutes, or cover and refrigerate overnight.
1. Bake in preheated oven for 35–45 minutes, or until top is golden and center is set. Let stand for 10 minutes to cool slightly.
1. Serve with additional syrup, if desired.
