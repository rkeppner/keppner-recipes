As I’ve stated before, with the exception of [Elephant Ears]({% post_url 2021-09-17-elephant-ears %}), I _almost never_ deep fat fry anything at home. But this year as fall rolled around and I started craving foods from the state fair, I decided I needed to come up with some alternatives. There is no way I’m driving for an hour, paying to get in, then standing in line and paying what they command for abberant food experiments. I no longer have that kind of energy or patience.

The air fryer donuts turned out well enough that I used that as inpiration for more concontions you can only find at the fair, some of which I’ve never even tried before. In short, if you can batter it and fry it, you can instead wrap it in crescent roll dough and air fry it. It’s not quite the same, of course, but scratches the itch without the travel.

### Ingredients

- 1 package refrigerator crescent rolls (8 count)
- 1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar

#### Filling Options

- Hot dogs (preferably all beef), cut in half
- Small peach quaters, peeled and pitted, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and a dash of salt
- Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups (frozen for 30 minutes)
- Fun size Snickers bars (frozen for 30 minutes)
- Double Stuf Oreo cookies

### Directions

1. Preheat air fryer to 320ºF.
2. Unroll crescent rolls and separate into triangles. Smaller triangles can be made by cutting each triangle in half, depending on the size of the filling.
3. Place filling of choice on the wide end of the triangle.
4. Wrap the crescent roll around the filling, pinching the edges to seal, doing your best to evenly distribute the dough around the filling.
5. Place in air fryer basket, leaving space between each.
6. Air fry for 10 minutes, until golden brown.
7. Brush with melted butter.
8. Use a mesh strainer to sprinkle with powdered sugar.
9. Enjoy as soon as they are cool enough to bite into without burning your mouth.
