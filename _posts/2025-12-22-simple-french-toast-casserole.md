I have another, fancier version of [French Toast Casserole]({% post_url 2025-01-12-french-toast-casserole %}) that I make occasionally, but this is a simpler, cheaper version that we also like.

### Ingredients

- 2 loaves French bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 8 large eggs
- 3 cups milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

#### Topping

- 1/2 cup margarine, cold and cut into small pieces
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

### Directions

1. Grease 12x18 inch roasting pan.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Pour over bread. Press bread down gently with a spatula to soak all bread. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
1. Remove casserole from refrigerator. Dot top with pieces of margarine.
1. In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle evenly over top of casserole.
1. Bake uncovered for 45 minutes, or until top is golden and center is set. Let stand for 10 minutes to cool slightly.
1. Serve warm with additional syrup.
