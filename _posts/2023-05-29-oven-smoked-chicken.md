This method gives a passible version of smoked chicken, without the need to buy a smoker. It works great with a convection oven, but I'm not sure how well it would work with a conventional oven. This can also be done in an air fryer, though you'll probably only be able to fit one leg quarter.

### Ingredients

- 1–4 chicken leg quarters
- liquid smoke
- salt
- barbecue rub (I sprinkle with pepper, granulated garlic, granulated onion, cajun seasoning, and sugar)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 225°F.
2. Rub chicken liberally with liquid smoke, and sprinkle well with salt. Let marinate for about an hour.
3. Dust each side heavily with barbecue rub spices.
4. Place chicken quarter(s) on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Place in center of oven, adding water to the baking sheet to catch drippings and provide moisture. Bake for about 6 hours, until chicken pulls away from the bone easily.
5. Remove from oven, and peel away skin. Let rest until cool enough to handle, then shred meat by hand, removing bones and cartilage.
6. Serve on rolls with barbecue sauce and pickles.
