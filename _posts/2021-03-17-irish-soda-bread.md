I used to be able to easily find soda bread at the grocery store for our St. Patrick's Day feast of corned beef and cabbage, but I've had trouble with that here in Idaho. So we make this homemade version instead.

### Ingredients

- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/4 cup cold butter, cut into 1/2" dice
- 1 3/4 cups cold buttermilk, shaken
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 cup dried currants

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â° F. Line sheet pan with parchment paper.
2. Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Add butter and mix on low until mixed in.
3. Lightly beat egg and buttermilk together. With mixer on low, slowly add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture. Combine currants with 1 tablespoon flour and mix into dough. (Dough will be quite wet.)
4. Dump dough onto well floured surface and knead it into a round loaf. Place loaf onto prepared sheet pan, and lightly cut an "X" into the top.
5. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. (Tapping the loaf should produce a hollow sound.)
6. Cool on baking rack.
