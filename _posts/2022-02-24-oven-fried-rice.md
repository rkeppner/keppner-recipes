I’ve kept fried rice on the menu rotation for a couple of years now, but making it from scratch just wasn’t worth the time and effort. Which is to say, I’ve been buying it from the freezer section. However, I recently came across [this method from Chef John](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2019/03/baked-fried-rice-once-cooked.html) that made me reevaluate making it at home. It turned out wonderfully for reasonable effort. Here’s my variation of it.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups long grain white rice
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1/2 cup sliced scallions
- 1/2 cup diced bell pepper
- 1/2 cup diced carrots
- 1/2 cup frozen green peas
- 1/2 cup frozen corn kernels
- 1 cup diced Chinese barbecue pork (or ham or cooked chicken)
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sriracha
- 1 teaspoon [Chinese five spice powder]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link_to 2022-02-23-chinese-five-spice-powder %})
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. Add rice, vegetable oil, sesame oil, and garlic to 9x13 inch casserole dish. Stir until thoroughly combined.
3. Add scallions, bell pepper, carrots, peas, corn, and meat, and mix well.
4. In a small pot, combine chicken broth, soy sauce, sriracha, and Chinese five spice powder. Over high heat, bring just to a simmer. Pour over rice mixture and stir in gently.
5. Cover casserole dish tightly with aluminum foil.
6. Place in oven and bake for 32 minutes.
7. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove foil and fluff rice.
8. If using, sprinkle sesame seeds evenly over surface of rice.
9. Place under broiler on high until surface forms a brown, crispy crust.
10. If desired, garnish with additional sliced, fresh scallions.
