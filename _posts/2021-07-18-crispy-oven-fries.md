I love french fries, but I hate the oil mess they make. And the fact that they're always soggy because I can't heat enough oil. This recipe solves those problems, though it _does_ dirty 2 pans instead of 1.

### Ingredients

- 4 large russet potatoes, peeled (optional) and cut into 1/2 inch fries
- 1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1/4 cup melted lard, melted coconut oil, or peanut oil

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
2. Bring large pot of water to a boil. Add vinegar and salt to water. Add potatoes and boil for 8 minutes. Gently pour fries into colander to drain, and let steam evaporate for several minutes.
3. Transfer fries to large baking sheet, and cover with fat/oil. Toss fries to completely cover them.
4. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Pull baking sheet out and flip fries. Return to oven for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Remove fries to parchment paper. Sprinkle to taste with salt, and let cool slightly.
