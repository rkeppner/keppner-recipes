Toad in the Hole is a classic British dish that consists of sausages baked in Yorkshire pudding batter. Any uncooked pork dinner sausage can be used, though the traditional choice would be English bangers. Unfortunately, finding them in the US has proven a challenge. In this case, I used the Irish Garlic sausages I found just before St. Patrick’s Day. The onion gravy is what really makes this dish, anyway.

### Ingredients

- 5 links uncooked pork sausages (about 1 pound)
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil

#### Yorkshire Pudding Batter

- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 teasoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 shakes Cajun seasoning
- pinch thyme
- 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 1/4 cup cold water

#### Onion Gravy

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 large onion, minced (red gives the best color)
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups beef or chicken broth
- 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon Balsamic vinegar
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- sliced scallions or chives to taste (optional)

### Directions

1. Prepare the batter by combining eggs, salt, pepper, Cajun seasoning, and thyme in a large bowl. Whisk until well blended.
1. Add the flour and milk, and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the cold water until the batter is well combined. Set aside to rest for 30–60 minutes.
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausages and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
1. Transfer the sausages with tongs to a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour all but 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil from the skillet over the sausages, using a pastry brush to evenly coat the baking dish, including the sides.
1. Start the gravy by melting the butter in the remaining oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the minced onion and salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and golden brown, about 10 minutes.
1. While the onions are cooking, pour the batter around the sausages in the baking dish. Place in the center of a cold oven, then turn the oven to 450°F. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the batter is puffed and golden brown.
1. While the batter and sausages are baking, finish the gravy. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and stir to coat. Cook for about 2 minutes until the flour is lightly browned. Whisk in the broth, a little at a time, until smooth. Add the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and vinegar. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Season with pepper to taste.
1. When the Toad in the Hole is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Spoon onion gravy over the sausages, and garnish with sliced scallions or chives, if using.
1. Serve immediately with additional gravy on the side.
