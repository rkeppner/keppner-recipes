One of the things that keeps me sane while dieting is making sure I still get sweets. Most of my sweet tooth cravings are satisfied by a couple diet soft drinks per day, but sometimes I need more of a dessert. This works perfectly.

### Ingredients

- 1 whole, frozen banana
- 4 "ice cubes" frozen skim milk
- 2 tablespoons skim milk
- 1 whole egg
- 2 tablespoons sucralose
- 2 tablespoons sugar free chocolate pudding mix
- 1 tablespoon powdered peanut butter
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- pinch salt

### Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in blender or food processor. Process until smooth.
2. Serve immediately.
