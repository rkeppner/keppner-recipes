When I find that the kids haven’t been eating the sandwich bread, I make a batch of French Toast to use it up. Though, if I have too many heels in the mix, [French Toast Casserole]({% post_url 2025-01-12-french-toast-casserole %}) works better to prevent picky eaters from avoiding them.

### Ingredients

- 12–15 slices bread, depending on size and thickness
- 6 large eggs
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- big pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon gound nutmeg

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease a 12x17 or 15x21 inch sheet pan.
1. Beat eggs in a large bowl with a whisk. Add milk, salt, sugar, vanilla, and nutmeg; whisk to combine.
1. Dip bread slices in egg mixture, turning to coat both sides. Arrange in a single layer in prepared pan.
1. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.
1. Turn broiler on high. Broil for 2–3 minutes, or until top is golden brown. Watch carefully to prevent burning.
1. Serve immediately, with syrup (if desired).
