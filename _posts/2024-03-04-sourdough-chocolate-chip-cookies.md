This is still a small batch of cookies, but with a much more complex (maybe even acquired) taste. The sourdough starter adds a tangy flavor to the cookies, and the texture is a bit chewier than the classic version. This is solely for flavor, not leavening.

As an added bonus, my kids don’t like them as much, which means I can keep more of them for myself. I usually freeze half the dough in measured “balls” to bake later, which gives me easy access to fresh cookies.

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup margarine or butter (1 stick), softened
- 3 ounces white sugar
- 3 ounces brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 3 ounces sourdough starter (100% hydration)
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 5 ounces all-purpose flour
- 1/8 ounce salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder (not soda)
- 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 1/3 cup chopped nuts (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line baking sheet with parchment, or grease it.
2. Cream together margarine or butter and sugars in mixing bowl on high speed for several minutes until light and fluffy. Add egg, sourdough starter, and vanilla; mix well.
3. Add flour, salt, and baking powder to wet ingredients, and mix on low speed until _almost_ all flour is incorporated.
4. Add chocolate chips and nuts (if using), and mix on low until just evenly distributed.
5. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto prepared baking sheet, arranging evenly. Bake until lightly golden, about 12 minutes, rotating half way through.
6. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.
