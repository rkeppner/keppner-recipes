Something like a liquid cheesecake, I love this filling in [crepes](/recipes/basic-crepes) with fresh berries.

### Ingredients

- 8 ounce package cream cheese, softened
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch kosher salt
- 1 cup whipped cream or whipped topping

### Directions

1. Beat cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and salt until smooth.
2. Add whipped cream or whipped topping, and mix just until smooth.
3. Spread on crepes, and add desired toppings.
