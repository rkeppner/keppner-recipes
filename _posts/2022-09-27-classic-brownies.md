Although I have [another brownie recipe]({% post_url 2021-07-17-condensed-milk-and-browned-butter-brownies %}) that I really prefer, the effort required means that I almost never make them. _This_ is the recipe that we actually use on a regular basis.

### Ingredients

- 2 sticks (1 cup) butter
- 2 cups sugar
- 4 eggs
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

#### Frosting (optional)

- 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) butter, softened
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/2 teastpoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup cocoa powder
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- pinch salt

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350ÂºF. Grease 9x13 inch baking pan.
2. Cream butter, sugar, and eggs together until fluffy. Add cocoa powder, flour, and salt. Mix until well incorporated.
3. Spread evenly in baking pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until edges begin to crisp. Remove to cooling rack.
4. While brownies are baking, mix all frosting ingredients together, and beat until smooth.
5. Frost brownies when completely cool.
