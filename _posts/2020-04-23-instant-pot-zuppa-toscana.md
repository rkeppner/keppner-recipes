This is a copycat version of the Olive Garden restaurant soup. It's another great recipe for cold weather, especially served with fresh, [homemade rolls]({% post_url 2024-11-17-soft-dinner-rolls %}).

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 pounds mild Italian sausage, without casing
- 2 medium onions, diced
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- pinch red pepper flakes
- 5 large russet potatoes, washed, quartered, and thinly sliced
- 3 quarts chicken stock
- 1 bunch kale, chopped and stems removed
- 2 cups whipping cream
- salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Add oil to pot, and spread to coat bottom. Add sausage and start sauté function; cook until browned, breaking up into small pieces.
1. Add onions and garlic, and sauté until onions are translucent. Add salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes; stir until fragrant.
1. Deglaze the pot with 1 cup of stock. Add potatoes and remaining stock. Use the _manual_ function to cook on maximum pressure for 0 minutes.
1. After cooking completes, immediately manually release any remaining pressure. (This will take several minutes.)
1. Open the pot, and start sauté function again.
1. Add kale; stir until soup begins to simmer.
1. Add cream, and stir until it returns to simmer.
1. Turn off. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve warm.
