This is a copycat version of the Olive Garden restaurant soup. It's another great recipe for cold weather, especially served with fresh, homemade rolls.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 pounds mild Italian sausage, without casing
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 medium onions, diced
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- 5 large russet potatoes, washed, quartered, and thinly sliced
- 3 quarts chicken stock
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 bunch kale, chopped and stems removed
- 2 cups whipping cream

### Directions

1. Melt butter in pot on _sauté_ setting. Add onion and sauté until softened.
2. Add garlic, thyme, and bay leaves. Continue to sauté for another minute. Add carrots and celery and sauté for an additional minute.
3. Deglaze the pot with 1/2 cup stock.
4. Add split peas, pork shanks, and remaining stock. Use the _manual_ function to cook on maximum pressure for 15 minutes.
5. After cooking completes, allow pressure to natural release for 10 minutes, then manually release any remaining pressure.
6. Remove pork shanks and set aside. Give soup a few quick stirs to thicken. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove meat from pork shanks, chop, and return to soup.
7. Serve warm.
