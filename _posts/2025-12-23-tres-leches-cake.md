Highly influenced by our years living in the Phoenix East Valley, our Christmas Eve dinner tradition leans heavily into hispanic cuisine, starting with tamales. This year, we are finishing off the meal with a variation on the classic tres leches cake.

### Ingredients

- 6 large eggs, separated
- 1 cup granulated sugar, divided
- 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

#### Milk Mixture

- 1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
- 1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream

#### Topping

- 1 cup [dulce de leche]({% post_url 2025-12-20-instant-pot-dulce-de-leche %}), chilled (optional)
- 2 cups whipped cream or whipped topping
- Ground cinnamon, for garnish (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Thoroughly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
1. In a large bowl, beat egg yolks with a hand mixer until light yellow. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar, beating until dissolved. Beat in vanilla and milk.
1. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until peaks form. Gradually beat in remaining 1/4 cup sugar until medium-stiff peaks form. Gently fold egg whites into yolk mixture.
1. In another bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Gently fold into egg mixture until thoroughly combined.
1. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool completely.
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream.
1. Once cake is cool, poke holes all over the top using a fork or skewer. Slowly pour milk mixture over the cake, allowing it to soak in.
1. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
1. Spread dulce de leche (if using) over the top of the cake. Spread whipped cream or whipped topping evenly over the cake. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon, if desired. Slice and serve chilled.
