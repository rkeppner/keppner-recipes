The whole family loves these with mashed potatoes, even though I'm too lazy to make the meatballs from scratch.

### Ingredients

- 28-32 ounce package frozen meatballs
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups beef broth or stock
- 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth or stock
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (optional)
- salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add meatballs and lightly brown on all sides. Transfer meatballs to bowl to rest.
1. Add remaining butter to skillet or pot. When butter is melted, whisk in flour. If needed, add a splash of oil. Cook for 4-5 minutes until golden brown. Slowly whisk in broth/stock until well combined.
1. Whisk in soy sauce, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar.
1. Increase heat to medium-high, and whisk in milk. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5-10 minutes until gravy thickens, stirring frequently.
1. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Lower heat to medium-low. Add meatballs to gravy and heat until warm. Garnish with parsley, if using.
1. Serve with mashed potatoes and lingonberry jam or whole berry cranberry sauce.
