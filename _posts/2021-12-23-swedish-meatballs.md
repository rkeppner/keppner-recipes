The whole family loves these with mashed potatoes, even though I'm too lazy to make the meatballs from scratch.

### Ingredients

- 28-32 ounce package frozen meatballs
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 6 cups beef broth or stock
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add meatballs and lightly brown on all sides. Transfer meatballs to bowl to rest.
2. Add remaining butter to skillet or pot. When butter is melted, whisk in flour and cook for 4-5 minutes until golden brown. Slowly whisk in broth or stock until well combined.
3. Increase heat to medium-high, and whisk in cream. Bring to a simmer, then whisk in sugar and Worcestershire sauce. Simmer for 6-7 minutes until thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Lower heat to medium-low. Add meatballs to gravy and heat until warm. Garnish with fresh, chopped parsley, if desired.
5. Serve with mashed potatoes and lingonberry jam or whole berry cranberry sauce.
