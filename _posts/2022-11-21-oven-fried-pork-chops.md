Last week I bought some large packages of pork chops at a crazy cheap price, and I needed a way to prepare them that didn’t involve me frying in oil for 45 minutes. It turned out pretty well.

### Ingredients

- 8 bone-in pork chops
- 1/2 cup butter, melted
- Salt and pepper to taste
- All purpose flour to coat all surfaces
- 2 whole eggs, salted and beaten
- 1/4 cup milk
- Panko bread crumbs to coat all sides (about 2 cups)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450ºF. Spread butter evenly over baking sheet.
2. Whisk milk into beaten eggs.
3. Coat all sides of chops with flour. Dip chops in egg wash. Generously coat chops in panko.
6. Arrange chops on buttered baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Flip chops, and cook until internal temperature reaches 145ºF (about 10 minutes more).
8. Allow chops to rest for a few minutes. Serve warm with [rice pilaf]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-11-22-instant-pot-rice-pilaf %}).
