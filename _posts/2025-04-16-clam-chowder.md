Once I figured out that clam chowder is really just potato soup (which I make all the time) with clams, I started making it once a month or so.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 8 ounces bacon, diced
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- large pinch salt
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced
- 2 cans (6.5 ounces each) chopped clams, with juice
- 1 bottle (8 ounces) clam juice
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 3 cups whole milk
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (or 2 teaspoons dried parsley)
- 1 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning
- Salt to taste
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced (optional)

### Directions

1. Melt butter in large, heavy cooking pot.
1. Add bacon. Cook until bacon is crispy. Remove bacon from pot and set aside.
1. Add onion, celery, and salt. Saut√© until onion is translucent.
1. Add flour. Stir to coat vegetables and cook for 1-2 minutes.
1. Add potatoes, clams with juice, clam juice, and thyme. Stir to mix.
1. Add water to cover potatoes, if necessary.
1. Bring to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are tender, stirring frequently, about 15-20 minutes.
1. Add milk, parsley, and Old Bay Seasoning. Stir to mix.
1. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
1. Adjust salt to taste.
1. Serve warm, garnished with reserved bacon, scallions (if using), and oyster crackers (if desired).
