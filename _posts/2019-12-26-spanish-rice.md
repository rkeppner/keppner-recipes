I needed a side dish filler to go with various Mexican dishes I serve at home (so that I can get away with serving less of the expensive stuff), and this fits the bill. Some of my kids really love it, while others just ignore it and focus on the expensive dishes. I've listed it here with Instant Pot instructions, since that's how I now prepare it, but it's easy enough to adapt to a regular stove top.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 cup carrots, diced (optional)
- 3 clove garlic, minced
- 1 cup frozen whole kernel corn
- 1 1/2 cups long grain white rice, thoroughly rinsed
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano, crushed
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce
- 1 10-ounce can Ro*Tel Original tomatoes and green chilies
- 2 green onions, white and green parts, sliced thinly (optional)
- 2 tablespoons cilantro leaves, finely chopped (optional)

### Directions

1. Heat oil on Instant Pot _sauté_ setting.
2. Add onion and sauté until translucent.
3. If using, add carrots and sauté until tender.
4. Add garlic and stir for 1 minute.
5. Add corn and stir through.
6. Add rice and toast until golden.
7. Add chili powder, cumin, and oregano, and "bloom" just until fragrant.
8. Add salt, chicken stock, tomato sauce, and Ro*Tel. Stir to combine.
9. Lock lid and set the steam valve to _sealing_ position. Press the _rice_ button or set on manual for 5 minutes. When the timer goes off, let the Instant Pot "natural release" for 10 minutes, then "quick release" any remaining pressure.
10. Fluff the rice with a fork.
11. Stir in green onions and/or cilantro, if using.
12. Serve.
