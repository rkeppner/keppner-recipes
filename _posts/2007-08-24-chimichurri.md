[Chimichurri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimichurri) is a marinade and/or sauce for beef, originally from Argentina, although Iâ€™m sure my recipe is not authentic. I actually made this a couple months back, but never got around to posting the recipe. Luckily, I saved the scrap of paper that I made up the recipe on, since it was a distillation of what I liked about a number of recipes. You can use it to marinade steaks (or other meat) or serve it at the table as a condiment.

### Ingredients

- 3/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1 bunch flat-leaf (also called Italian) parsley
- 1 medium onion
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 red bell pepper
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon bay leaf, crushed
- 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt
- 1 tablespoon black pepper
- hot chili flakes to taste

### Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in food processor and process until finely chopped
2. Marinade meat in sauce for 30 minutes to 3 hours.
3. Cook meat slowly over open flame, discarding remaining marinade.
