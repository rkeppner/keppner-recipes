My wife used to occasionally make _monkey bread_ for breakfast on holidays, but she hasn’t done so for a number of years. When I came across [this recipe from Chef John](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2024/11/monkey-bread-set-it-down-and-get-out-of.html), I decided to make it to go with Thanksgiving dinner this year, instead of yet another pie.

### Ingredients

- 1 1/3 cups warm milk (110°F)
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 stick unsalted butter, melted
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
- 1/2 cup chopped dried cranberries

#### Cinnamon Sugar
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

#### Caramel Syrup
- 2 sticks unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon orange zest

### Directions

1. In mixer bowl with dough hook, pour in warm milk and sprinkle in yeast; let sit 15–20 minutes.
2. Add sugar, egg, 3/4 of the melted butter, flour, and salt. Knead on low until a soft, smooth, elastic dough forms (about 10 minutes). Add walnuts and cranberries, and knead until evenly distributed.
3. Cover bowl and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size (about 1 1/2 hours).
4. Preheat oven to lowest setting, and turn off.
5. Butter bundt pan generously; set aside. Butter work surface, and put dough on it. Stretch and press dough into a 15-inch square. Brush generously with melted butter.
6. Using pizza cutter, cut dough into 64 equal squares. Roll each square into a ball, and roll in cinnamon sugar. Place lightly into prepared bundt pan.
7. Place pan in warm oven, and proof for about 30 minutes.
8. Remove pan from oven, and preheat to 350°F.
9. Meanwhile, make caramel syrup by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in brown sugar, and stir occasionally until mixture just begins to buble slightly. Remove from heat, and whisk in orange zest. Continue whisking until sauce is smooth. Pour over dough balls, covering evenly.
10. Bake in preheated oven until skewer inserted in center comes out clean (about 35 minutes). Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto serving plate. Let cool to just warm before serving.
