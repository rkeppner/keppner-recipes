My mother makes this cheese ball for family gatherings, so when I got the recipe from her, I wanted to make sure I could always find it. It works great with all kinds of crackers.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons chopped olives
- 1 teaspoon dried dill weed
- 1 teaspoon worchestershire sauce
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

- 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
- 1 cup sunflower seeds or chopped nuts

### Directions

1. Mix all ingredients except sunflower seeds or nuts together.
2. Shape mixture into a ball. Roll in sunflower seeds or chopped nuts to cover ball.
3. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours.
4. Serve with various kinds of crackers.
