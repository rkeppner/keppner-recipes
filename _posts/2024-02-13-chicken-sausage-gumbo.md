I’m not sure I’d ever made a real gumbo before, but when I realized it was Marti Gras, I decided I had to do _something_. This is true comfort food, and much more in my wheelhouse than beniets or king cake.

### Ingredients

- 6 chicken thighs, skin on but bone removed
- salt
- Cajun seasoning
- 12 oz. andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1/2 large red bell pepper, chopped
- 1/2 large green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 6 cups chicken stock
- 1 cup tomato purée
- 4 teaspoons filé powder, divided
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
- 3 bay leaves
- Louisiana hot sauce
- 2 cups frozen okra
- 2 scallions, sliced thinly
- [Steamed white rice]({% post_url 2024-01-14-instant-pot-rice %}), for serving

### Directions

1. Season chicken thighs with salt and Cajun seasoning. Place in large, cold Dutch oven, skin side down. Raise the heat to medium-high, and cook until the skin crisps and renders out as much fat as possible. Lower the heat to medium, and flip the thighs over, cooking for an additional 3 minutes or so, until done. Remove from pot and set aside.
1. Add the andouille sausage to the pot and brown on each side. Remove from pot and set aside.
1. Lower the head to medium low. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom, until it turns a rich, chocolate brown color (about 10 minutes). Add the tomato paste and stir until well combined.
1. Add the onion, bell peppers, celery, and garlic to the pot and cook until softened.
1. Add the chicken stock and tomato purée, and stir until well combined. Increase the heat to bring mixture to a simmer, allowing it to thicken.
1. Remove skin from chicken thighs and shred the meat. Add the chicken, sausage, 2 teaspoons of filé powder, Cajun seasoning, and bay leaves to the pot. Stir to combine. Simmer for 2 hours on low heat, stirring occasionally.
1. Add the okra, the remaining 2 teaspoons of filé powder, and a few shakes of hot sauce to the pot. Stir to combine and simmer for an additional 10 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and/or hot sauce as needed.
1. Serve with steamed rice and sprinkled with fresh scallions.
