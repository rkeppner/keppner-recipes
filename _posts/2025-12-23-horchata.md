Yet another item for the Christmas Eve feast. Originally we bought horchata from a local Mexican grocery store, and we’ve occasionally made it with store-bought rice milk, but this year I’m trying a recipe from scratch. Much cheaper (and arguably more authentic) this way.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup long-grain white rice
- 1/4 cup raw almonds
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 7 cups water, divided
- ground cinnamon, for garnish (optional)

### Directions

1. In a blender, combine rice, almonds, and cinnamon stick, sugar, vanilla, and 4 cups of water. Blend until rice and almonds are coarsely ground. Add remaining water and blend to combine.
1. Refrigerate mixture overnight.
1. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth into a large pitcher. Discard solids.
1. Serve over ice, garnished with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon, if desired.
