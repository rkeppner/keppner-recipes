I love sourdough, but most of the methods I’ve seen for it are time and labor intensive. This method, adapted from [Ben Starr](https://www.youtube.com/@ultimatefoodgeek), is incredibly flavorful, but requires very little active work. However, like any sourdough, it does require time to develop and do the work itself.

### Ingredients

- 4 ounces [sourdough starter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_PghQtLZtk) (100% hydration)
- 12 ounces water
- 1 pound 4 ounces all-purpose flour (or bread flour)
- 3/4 ounce Morton’s kosher salt
- Olive oil spray

### Directions

1. Bring starter to room temperature. Stir thoughroughly to reincorporate any liquid that has separated.
2. Measure starter, water, flour, and salt into a large bowl. Stir to combine. Mix with hands until all flour is incorporated and bowl is clean.
3. If there is less than 6 ounces of starter remaining in the container, [make more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3rLXdnEC3g) by adding equal weights of water and flour to at least double its weight but not fill the container more than half full. Stir to combine. Cover lightly, and let sit at room temperature for several hours until bubbles can be seen forming. Then refrigerate until needed.
4. Cover with plastic wrap, and let sit for about 20 hours.
5. Spray a Dutch oven with olive oil spray. Gently turn dough out onto a floured surface. Flour hands and tuck dough under itself to form a tight boule (ball). Place in Dutch oven, seam side down. Cover with lid, and let rest for 90 minutes.
6. Remove lid, and score top of dough with scissors.
7. Replace lid, and place in cold oven. Set temperature to 425° F, and bake for 45 minutes. Remove lid, and bake for another 15 minutes.
8. Remove loaf to baking rack. Let cool completely before slicing.
