When I lived in the Phoenix East Valley, I used to order P.F. Chang’s Chicken Lettuce Wraps (especially for takeout) on a pretty regular basis. This is a pretty close approximation of that dish, with a lot more vegetables. When I’m willing to put in the effort to make it myself.

### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 1 teaspoon (2 cloves) garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons ginger paste
- 1 pound ground chicken (or turkey, pork, or beef)
- 1/2 cup carrots, finely diced
- 1/2 cup bell pepper, finely diced
- 1/2 cup zucchini, finely diced
- 1 cup mushrooms, finely diced
- 8 ounce can diced water chestnuts, drained
- 1 head butter lettuce, leaves separated
- Cucumber, julienned (optional)
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

#### Sauce

- 1/4 cup hoisin sauce
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 teaspoons sriacha sauce
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Directions

1. Whisk together sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.
1. Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, bell pepper, and zucchini and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.
1. Add garlic and ginger paste; cook for about 1 minute, until fragrant. Scrape to side of pan.
1. Add ground chicken and cook until browned, breaking up completely.
1. Add mushrooms and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.
1. Reduce heat to medium low. Add water chestnuts and sauce, and stir to combine completely. Cook until most of sauce is absorbed, about 3–4 minutes.
1. If using, add cucumber and mix to combine.
1. Serve in lettuce leaves, garnished with scallions and sesame seeds.
