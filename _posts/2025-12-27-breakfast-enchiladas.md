I’m a sucker for enchiladas, so when I ran across this recipe for for a breakfast variation, I had to try it. I really liked it, but I do have to plan ahead since it soaks overnight.

### Ingredients

- 2 pounds breakfast sausage
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 bunch scallions, sliced (with some reserved for garnish)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, divided
- 1 dozen large corn tortillas
- 1 pound cheddar cheese, shredded
- 5 large eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- A few shakes Mexican hot sauce, to taste
- 1 (10 ounce) can green enchilada sauce
- 2 tablespoons all purpose flour

### Directions

1. Grease a 9x13 baking dish.
1. Brown sausage in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking it up as it cooks. Drain excess fat.
1. Add bell pepper, scallions, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder to the skillet, stirring to combine. Warm through, and remove from heat.
1. Warm tortillas until pliable. Fill each with sausage mixture and cheese, then roll up and place seam-side down in prepared baking dish.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, salt, pepper, remaining garlic powder, hot sauce, and 1/4 cup enchilada sauce. Sprinkle flour over mixture and whisk in throroughly.
1. Pour egg mixture over enchiladas. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over top of everything. Cover tightly with aluminum foil, and refrigerate overnight.
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
1. Bake enchiladas, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove foil, sprinkle with additional cheese, and bake additional 15–20 minutes, until top is lightly browned and egg mixture is set. Let stand 10 minutes, and serve with reserved scallions.
