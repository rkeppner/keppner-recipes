Another new addition to our menu, it's one of the few ways that I still like to eat a decent amount of vegetables. We frequently have it with [Jeera Rice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-01-30-instant-pot-jeera-rice %}) and [Kheema Matar]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-08-24-kheema-matar %}).

### Ingredients

- 1 cup frozen peas
- 1 head cauliflower, broken into bite-sized pieces
- 2 large carrots, diced into 1/2 inch pieces
- 4 small potatoes, peeled and diced into 1/2 inch pieces
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
- seeds from 4 green cardamom pods
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1–2 inch piece of ginger, peeled
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil
- 1 green chili pepper, minced
- 1/2 onion, minced
- 1 roma tomato (or canned), diced
- 1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- heavy sprinkle garam masala
- 1 can coconut milk
- 1/2 cup plain, full-fat Greek yogurt
- chopped cilantro leaves

### Directions

1. Set pot of water on to boil. Prep vegetables. When water is boiling, add 1/2 teaspoon salt and vegetables; par cook for 3–5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. Crush with mortar and pestle or grind with grinder: mustard seed, cumin seed, fenugreek seed, and cardamom seeds. Add garlic and ginger, and crush or grind to paste.
3. To wok, dutch oven, or large pot, add cooking oil and bring to medium heat. Add chili pepper, onion, and tomato; sauté for 1–2 minutes until it starts to brown. Add seasoning paste, chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Cook for another 1–2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add yogurt and coconut milk, stirring to combine.
4. Turn heat to low; add peas and cooked vegetables. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly (about 10 minutes). Adjust sauce consistency with more yogurt or water, as desired. Taste and add salt as needed to enhance flavors.
5. Garnish with cilantro leaves and serve with Jeera Rice or naan.
