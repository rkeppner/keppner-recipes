Hi, I’m Russell Keppner. These are my recipes. I put them here so that I can find them again, and so that when friends ask for the recipe for something I brought to a potluck (or won a chili competition with), I can just tell them to Google it. I’m lazy like that.

Feel free to adapt and use anything here, but if you publish it elsewhere, I’d appreciate credit and a link back. Thanks!
