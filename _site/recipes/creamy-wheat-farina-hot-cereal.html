    <p>I always liked <em>Cream of Wheat</em> cereal growing up, but we didn’t have it very often. And while we’ve been raising our kids, we’ve usually opted for hot cereals that I could buy in bulk, since they end up much cheaper. But this week I found that our local WinCo sells <a href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/wheat-farina.html">Bob’s Red Mill Wheat Farina</a> in bulk, so I bought some to see how it compares. Turns out it tastes just like I remember, for pennies per serving.</p>

<p>I originally wanted to cook it in the Instant Pot, like I do with all of the other cooked cereals, but in doing a little investigating, that seems to lead to lumps. And since it takes less than 5 minutes to make it the traditional way, there’s really no point in dirtying the Instant Pot.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>6 cups water</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups white wheat farina</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
  <li>2/3 cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Bring water and salt to a boil.</li>
  <li>Slowly whisk in cereal, and reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
  <li>Cook for 3 minutes, whisking frequently.</li>
  <li>Remove from heat and let stand for 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add butter, sugar, and milk, and whisk to combine thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Serve warm.</li>
</ol>
