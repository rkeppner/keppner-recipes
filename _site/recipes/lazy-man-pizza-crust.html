    <p>I finally decided that I wanted decent pizza crust enough to make it myself, but not enough to actually maintain a sourdough starter. Or knead it repeatedly. This recipe yields a great flavor and wonderful texture, and there’s no real kneading to speak of. It does however take about 24 hours, so you have to think ahead.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>7 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
  <li>4 teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
  <li>3 cups water</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Whisk dry ingredients together in medium-sized bowl.</li>
  <li>While stirring with a wooden spoon, gradually add water until combined.</li>
  <li>Mix gently with hands to form a rough ball, incorporating all flour.</li>
  <li>Cover bowl and leave at room temperature for about 18 hours.</li>
  <li>Turn onto clean, floured surface. Using a dough scraper, divide into 4 or 6 equal portions (depending on how thick you want your crusts).</li>
  <li>Fold each portion over several times, then form into a smooth ball. Cover tightly.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Optional:</strong> For each portion, drizzle a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil into a glass bowl, and roll dough portion in oil to cover it and the inside of the bowl with oil. Cover bowl tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks, which will further develop the flavor.</p>

    <p><em>If this method is used, remove the bowl(s) from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature before continuing with steps below.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Let rise at room temperature for an additional 2-6 hours.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to maximum heat (e.g. 500 or 550 degrees). If using a pizza stone or steel, preheat it as well.</li>
  <li>Dust each portion with flour and stretch to desired size. Place on pizza pan or peel. Add sauce, cheese, and toppings as desired.</li>
  <li>Bake until bottom is crisp and shows dark brown spots. Remove to cooling rack until cool enough to cut.</li>
</ol>
